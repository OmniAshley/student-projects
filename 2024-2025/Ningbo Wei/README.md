### 1. build a demo google chrom extention, with simple frontend
- **why google chrom extention**: For better extract the data from users, including their Browsing History
- **sub tasks**: build an backend and frontend, ensure that user can have interaction with it.
- access the content of each tabs on the browser
- extract both text and images, but need to clean those advertesment/cookies setting info if necessary
- show the info of this tab(title, low-image) on the user interface

### 2 built a backendand and a frontend
- user need to open this throug http8080....
- **why built a new backend and frontend instead of using chrom extention?**
    - more flexibility and extentionable, easy to achieve complex functions and implementing testing. 
    - Can implement and manten them individually.
    - It is easier and more flexble to use api form python comparing to javascripts
    - But still require to built a google extention to gain the user's info

###  3. use Large Lanuage Model, summerise the tab and groups tabs with similar/related info
- first needs to find a proper LLM api
- summerise the info in a tab, analyise its text info, image info and others through different LLMs. 
- Genthering similar/related tabs, like tabs for shopping and tabs for postgraduat degree application, summerise all the info of tabs in a group and give it a title
- **New**: generate an MindMap of a tab or a group of tabs if user ask to. This mind map is generate in markdown fromate through LLM, but displayed as a picture in user interface. This mind map can be shared to other users, together with web links of the info(only contain the final result).
- All the info above, including browsing history and all kinds of summerise, will be stored in a data base so that user can review it.

### 4. User LLM, provide a interface for user to ask question
- the material to answer this question comes from tabs that user is viewing/ have viewed, together with the knolege that the LLM has already have.

### 5. testing

### What are these different to previous works?
- build a new backend and frontend different from google extention. Pytthon based Flask for backend, React for frontend.
- It can generate an mindmap after grouping all the related tabsã€‚ For examples, display the advantage of different schools when search for postgraduate application, or analyise the prices and quality of each product when search for shopping, even Corporate campus recruitment information.
- It allow user to ask question based on current tab/ current groups of tabs/ known knowledge of the LLM.
- This time I will try to add LLM api that focusiong image analyise, increase the information from text based api.
