# Final report outline

## Introduction
### Motivation
- current situation in user web browser using
- Hard for users to make judement in a serise of messy tabs
- The important of visualisation in sense-making.
- The use of LLM in sense-making
### Related works and background
- sensemap, -- lack of functions in automatically tabs clustering and explanations
- CoSense, -- use shared workspace to support real-time team work
- Large language model
    - gpt and its usage in tools for sense-make
- pervious students work
    - jiaqiLi, --lack of user interaction in tab commenting/high lighting, advance searching functions and group working functions.
### Aims and Objectives
build a Google Chrome extension with LLM that processes user browsing information to improve efficiency in multitasking situations. Comparing to previous approaches, this mainly focuses on improving userâ€™s interaction with the tools, better application of LLM for tab analysis and grouping, achieving result sharing for team collaboration. 
- Visualise user's massive and chaotic browsing information. (in a chrome extention)
- Apply LLM for information analyze, grouping and filtering.
- Achieve a chatbot for advance searching.
- Built an user interface supporting strong user interaction. 
- Establish information sharing and importing function for group working.
## Description of the work
### User analysis
- what user really want for a visualisation tool?
### requiements 
- use case diagram

## Design and Methodology
### Interface design
- prototype
### System design
- Architecture of the system
### Back-end Methodology
- use chrome extentsion as backend for page content extraction
- use chrome local storage
    - reason why not use scync storage and strcuterd data basd like python+sqlite
- apply gpt-4o-mini in hrome extentsion for page and task summary
    - reason why given up adding image-to-text summary
- node grouping: LLM based grouping, word embedding+cosine simmilarty, tf-idf

## Implementation
### web page recognition
- code and prompt
### making summaries of pages and tasks
- code and prompt
- how to handle 429 problem
### node grouping
- code+prompt
- problem of law accuracy in user customize grouping (word embedding + cosine simmilaryty)
### Advance searching
- answer question in tab/task
- inspriation of "RAG"
### main interface
- fomat/structure of data in the storage

## prototype walk-through (is this the user handbook?)

## Evaluation
### Preliminary Preparation
- Participant selection
- Task design 
- Evalutaion, user question, interview
- quantitative features, usability analysis
- discuss


## Discussion

## Conclution
