Discussed the tasks for minimal working demo.
- Less ambitious: maximum 2 weeks to complete

Ningbo
- it is OK to use data from prevous student projects.
- choose a very small user task, such as comparing the prices (of a single product) from different website.

Xingyu
- scenario: User select a column and the LLM tries to find the best matching concept from the ontology
- there can be more than one matches

# Meeting 2 Oct 2024

Manais, Xingyu, Ningbo, Kai (Abhay is ill)

Went through [How the project works](https://github.com/Vis4Sense/student-projects/?tab=readme-ov-file#how-the-project-works), [Project topics](https://github.com/Vis4Sense/student-projects/?tab=readme-ov-file#project-topics), and [Software and services](https://github.com/Vis4Sense/student-projects/blob/main/instructions/software.md).

## To Do
1. Creat a folder under '2024-2025' with your name. This will be the home folder for your code, data, and reports
2. Create a `readme.md` in your folder, within it list all the project tasks that you can think of for a _minimal working demo_, a simplest possible prototype that have all the necessary components.
   - For example for trading, this includes reading in the data, decide whether and how to trade (can be rule based), execute the trade, and record the results for performance comparison.
   - We will complete this  'minimal working demo' first, as it will help narrow the project focus and set the rest of the tasks.
