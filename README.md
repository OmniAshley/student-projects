# Student Projects
Repository for all the student projects, including UG/PGT final projects and intern projects.

## Project topics
- Please see the background and possible ideas [on my website](https://kaixu.me/projects/).
- We will need to further narrow down the scope for your project:
  - I will help you do this;
  - We will define the work for each student if there are more than one working on the same project.  
- Please read at least one paper (listed at the end of the page) from beginning to end. 
  - Figure out what the research question is, and narrow down yours in the same way;
  - Copy the process from requirements, design, implementation, to evaluation for your project;
  - You will get 80+ mark if the project results can be published in a similar conference or journal;
