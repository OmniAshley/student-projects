# Student Projects
Repository for all the student projects, including UG/PGT final projects and intern projects.

## How the project works
- While each student will have his/her own project, I encourage all students to work togeher as much as possible to share the common work such as data collection.
- You will **need to be proactive**, especially if you want a good grade:
  - I will provide general directions, but not step-by-step instructions (you will need to figure these out);
  - Such as finding relevant papers, coming up with new design idea, and exploring implementation options;
  - I am always here to help if you have any question or difficulty: **ask as soon as you can if something is not clear or you got stuck.**
- Have a look of the **previous student projects**:
  - Someone has worked on your topic already; you don't need to start from scratch.
- We will have weekly meetings:
  - In person or online;
  - We will go through each project at the meeting (we may need to split into two groups);
  - You need to **update your progress** since last meeting and discuss any questions/difficulties;
  - **Set the tasks** before next meeting.

## Project topics
- Please see the background and possible ideas [on my website](https://kaixu.me/projects/).
- We will need to further narrow down the scope for your project:
  - I will help you do this;
  - We will define the work for each student if there are more than one working on the same project.  
- Please read at least one paper (listed at the end of the project idea webpage) **from beginning to end**. 
  - Figure out what the research question is, and narrow down yours in the same way;
  - Copy the process from requirements, design, implementation, to evaluation for your project;
  - You will get 80+ mark if the project results can be published in a similar conference or journal;

## Ethics
1. Preliminary ethics form: to decide if you need to submit the full ethics form
2. Full eithics form (most of you will need to): for this you will need
   - recruitment materials
   - information sheet
   - consent form
   - privacy notice
1. Data Management Plan (DMP)
2. More details on the [webpage](https://workspace.nottingham.ac.uk/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=CompSci&title=Research+Ethics+Guidelines+for+Academic+Staff%2C+Researchers+and+Students).

## [Literature review](instructions/literature.md)

## User requirements
- What users to find:  
  - Find users your work targets, not just your family and friends (sometimes they are the targeted users)
  - An alternative is company/organisation/charity that work with real users (they can get you in contact with the users).
  - Find someone local if possible: much easier for the communication.
- Requirements 
  - Get the requirements from the real users, not what you think: you might not know what users wants, unless you are a targeted user.
  - The requirements should be about the **problems** or **challenges**, not the technology or solution
    - For example, 'I cannot create the prompt for chatGPT to generate the text I want' instead of 'I want a prompt autocomplete feature when using the chatGPT web interface'.
  - How to get requirements
    - Recruite some users
    - Collection information such as their gender, age group, education background, student/working, experience/familarity with the topic, etc.
    - Observe how they complete the task you want to support, focusing on the **problems** and **challenges**.
    - Talk to the users afterwards for clarification (e.g., why did you do this?) and comments (e.g., what was the most difficult part?)
    - Take notes during the observation and interview.
    - Analyse the notes to come up with the list of requirements.
- There are a few talks on ['How to Talk to Users'] by [YCombinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) a very successful startup incubator (airbnb, dropbox, stripe, etc.)

## Design
Paper prototype/wireframe tool: 
- Pencil and paper
- Low fidelity: PowerPoint or Balsamiq https://balsamiq.com/
- High fidelity: ***Figma*** (recommended) https://www.figma.com
  - Free (until Adobe starts to charge for it)
  - Web-based: easy to share with other, and allow co-editing and comments
  - Support advanced feature such as 'interaction mockup': user can click a box (that looks like a button) and a new screen is displayed (by loading another wireframe)
  - The [official tutoral](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/sections/4405269443991-Figma-for-Beginners-tutorial-4-parts-) and there are also many on YouTube like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZJOSK4gXl4).

### Evaluation/Feedback

- Show user the paper prototype/wireframe and get feedback.
- Revise the desgin and project scope accordingly.
