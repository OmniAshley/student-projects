We will use this folder for the MSc and intern projects in summer 2023.

Please use this file for all the meeting notes. 

## Project chocie
- Aijing: to support end users, such as artists, to use generative AI models, such as stable diffusion (dalle2, midjourney), through web interface
- Meirong: Create a browser extension that provide end-to-end support for online shopping
- Xinhao: Create a browser extension to support the usage of LLM or generative AI models through their web interface
- Yu: Projection of provenance vector sequence
- Yuchen: Improve the design of the HistoryMap so the tree fits better within a Chrome side panel

# 4 Aug 2023

Present: Xinhao, Meirong, Yuchen, Yu, Aijing

## Discussions
- Yuchen: complete wireframe,
   - try to improve the vertical layout (sidebar): similar to windows explorer design
   - maybe consider has a pane at the bottom (horizontal layout):
      - there is no internal Chrome API to support (as far as I am aware)
      - maybe there needs to an option to swith between the horizontal and vertical layout.
## ToDo
- update the requirements and design sketch/wireframe based on the discussions during the meeting
- start the coding for first prototype (with only the bare minimal core functions)
- upload the requirements, design, and initial code to the this repository
   - Don't wait until everything is fully completed before uploading. This might be too late to change, which is mostly likely to happen.

## ToDo
- Make sure there is no overlapping between the tasks in the plan
- Update the plan tasks according to the project change, such as new things need to learn
- Make sure each task has a reasonble amount of time to complete.
   - It is not feasible to complete the coding needed for a prototype in a few days
   - Need to reduce the number of tasks if there is not enough time to complete all of the existing ones
- Complete the tasks in the plan and update the plan accordingly.
