# __something about sketch.png__

I compose a simple sketch of my visualization tool I want to develop as sketch.png shows
There are some ideas I suppose to do on that.

* I divided the User Interface into four areas, one of which is the area of file. The user can direactly drag the file into the first area, and the filename will be shown there.

* After choosing a file, the second area will show the data, especially, there will be a sidebar next to the area consisting of the details of the data (including types, names, etc.) if it could be recognized.

* In third area, the user can choose the method of dimensional reduction, such as MDS, PCA, t-SNE, etc.

* And the visualization plot will be shown in the last area with some legends of that.
    * every point represents a task or an action of the process.
    * if the user repeats the same action or does some subtasks, it will be a dual-track. And user can see the subtasks when clicking on that point.
    * the user can change the pattern of performance, like time plot, linear plot, or even 3D plot if necessary.
 


# __User task that the project will support__

This project will develop a visualization tool aiming at academic researchers in related fields such as information science, social sciences, communication, or computer science. This project will help them study the online sensemaking behaviors, information diffusion, and knowledge creation by using this tools, especially in the following aspects:

1. Tracing Information Flow: Users can trace the flow of information from its origins to its destination, understanding how information is disseminated, transformed, and connected across different concepts or topics.
2. Identifying Key Concepts: Users can identify the key concepts or topics that emerge during sensemaking. They can observe the relationships between these concepts and understand their importance in the overall information flow.
3. Detecting Information Trends: Users can detect emerging trends or shifts in the sensemaking process by observing changes in the frequency or strength of information flows between different concepts.
4. Comparing Sensemaking Strategies: Users can compare the sensemaking strategies of different individuals or groups by examining their information flows and interaction patterns within the visualization.
