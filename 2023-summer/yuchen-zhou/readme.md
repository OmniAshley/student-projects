## This section describes how to use code. 
' 4.0','5.0','6.0'are the results of different versions. You need to download the entire file, open the developer mode of chrome, upload the folder, and open it in the plug-in section. It should be noted that the running results are not very stable due to time constraints. It may be related to the open website, which may sometimes lead to results or failure to run. I will optimize this later. Besides the first time, the 'side panel' folder records some basic codes, such as how to build a side panel. ' The first Extension'is an application that records my first Chrome extension.
Because some programs can not run, I uploaded screenshots of different parts.
