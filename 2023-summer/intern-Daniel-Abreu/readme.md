## Notes - 22 June 2023 
Issues:
- Order of execution
- Watch process to recomplie 
- Using a devcointarer for the extension

 

Installation Process to use Loops:
1-Install Docker
2-NodeJS
3-https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-template
4-Python 3.9
5-Copier
6-Trrack extension
7-HTML Diff Extension by Armantang

 

Potential Additions:
- Add a toggle list to transverse between versions
- Side by side comparison similar to Git
- Notification system to alert the user of completion
- Tips to running a notebook, such as the recommendation to change runtime type (CPU to GPU)
- Hyperparameter changes via the library UI
- Notes/Comment tracking of each version so the user can notate how their changes have impacted different versions and for recalling purposes
- Prompt retrieval function from a previous version
