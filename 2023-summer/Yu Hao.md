# __something about sketch.png__

I compose a simple sketch of my visualization tool I want to develop as sketch.png shows
There are some ideas I suppose to do on that.

* I divided the User Interface into four areas, one of which is the area of file. The user can direactly drag the file into the first area, and the filename will be shown there.

* After choosing a file, the second area will show the data, especially, there will be a sidebar next to the area consisting of the details of the data (including types, names, etc.) if it could be recognized.

* In third area, the user can choose the method of dimensional reduction, such as MDS, PCA, t-SNE, etc.

* And the visualization plot will be shown in the last area with some legends of that.
    * every point represents a task or an action of the process.
    * if the user repeats the same action or does some subtasks, it will be a dual-track. And user can see the subtasks when clicking on that point.
