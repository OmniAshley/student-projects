## Interview with Geat (amateur user of StableDiffusion)

Q: What do you primarily use AI drawing for now?

A: Generally, I use it to create character illustrations for my own artworks.

Q: Do you often use AI drawing to illustrate your own characters?

A: Yes, because I lack drawing skills myself, and currently, there are many AI drawing platforms available. It's a convenient way for me to visualize my characters.

Q: Are there any aspects of using AI drawing that you find less satisfactory?

A: In my opinion, the style generated by AI can easily deviate due to the training dataset. For example, it might only excel at drawing female characters. Also, it struggles to recognize most specific terms, such as "cyberpunk-style armor." There is a tendency for confusion between elements like "cyberpunk" and "armor (which might lead the AI to associate it with medieval styles)." This can result in creations that are somewhat mismatched, despite having certain details, but not aligning with the specified tags.

An example is when I provided a prompt: __"Black shirt, feather pattern on the right shoulder, white shorts, black headphones, nineteen years old, male, black eyes, black ear-length hair."__ The AI often fails to blend the elements coherently based on the description. The feather pattern on the right shoulder is usually interpreted as scattered feathers or wings. Additionally, I anticipate a manga style similar to "Black Butler," but merely specifying "manga" doesn't cover the diverse styles from different artists. The available keywords lack the granularity needed for such distinctions. Moreover, certain concepts that are easily understood by humans are challenging for AI, such as the age of nineteen and the concepts of left and rightâ€”likely due to AI's lack of human "common sense."
