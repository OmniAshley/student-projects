## Verdant Reading Notes

### Requirements (for Data Analysis Process)

__Difficulty__: It is usually difficult for Data Scientists to retrieve their previous experiment and choices, they often confuse: "why I made such a choice, or what did this experiment tell me? under what assumption and with what results did I conduct this experiment?"

__Approaches__: Take notes, use version control tools, copy all experiment process into checkpoints. Disadvantage: not clear and intuitive enough.

__Requirements__: A 1.complete and 2.resonably intepreted history for data analysis.

### Previous Works

These works provide complete or semi-complete history by auto-capturing heckpoints of a data scientist's work at regular time intervals (e.g. every run of code)
