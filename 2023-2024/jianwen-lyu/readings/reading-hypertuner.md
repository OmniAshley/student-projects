## HyperTuner: Visual Analytics for Hyperparameter Tuning by Professionals

- previous ways of model tuning (including hyper-parameter tuning)
    - vidualization of model structures
    - interpret mode output (predictions) with visualization
    - automatic hyper-paramter tuning algorithms (grid-search, random search)

- problem: data science practitioners usually spend a considerable amount of time manually tuning hyperparameters, taking notes on paper notebooks or building their own visualizations due to the limited visual analytics support
