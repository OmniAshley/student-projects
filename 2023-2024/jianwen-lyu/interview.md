Q: Have you had any experience using AI painting for independent creation? (If yes, please briefly describe.)

A: When I have something in mind to draw, I first look for a pre-trained model like Lora, learn how to use it (what prompts were used to generate the images I want), and then modify the prompt accordingly.

Q: What is the AI painting model you currently use most frequently? (For example, StableDiffusion, DiscoDiffusion, etc.)

A: StableDiffusion

Q: When creating with AI painting, what form of prompt do you generally use for the initial round of image generation?

1. Simple description of the subject, style, and scene (e.g., "Wolf girl eating an apple on a carriage, anime style").

2. Arrangement of keywords (e.g., "Girl on a carriage," "White headscarf," "Eating apple," "Wolf tail," "Wolf ears," "Medieval wheat field background," "Anime style").

3. Detailed description of the subject, style, and scene (e.g., "A girl sitting on a carriage, holding her chin and eating an apple, with wolf ears and tail, medieval wheat field background, anime style, high quality...").

A: 3

Q: Do you usually have clear ideas and creative inspiration before using AI painting, and do you have fairly clear expectations for the desired outcome?

A: Yes

Q: In AI painting creation, does the initially generated image generally meet your needs? If not, how do you typically modify your prompt for the second round of image generation?

A: The first generated image usually doesn't meet my needs. I will emphasize certain details more specifically in subsequent iterations (such as what should be where, but sometimes it doesn't work).

Q: Generally, after multiple iterations and prompt optimizations, does the AI painting model mostly deliver the results you desire?

A: Generally, it can provide results that I'm reasonably satisfied with at a glance, without looking at specific details.

Q: What issues do you think exist in the AI painting model in terms of understanding your prompt? (Examples would be greatly appreciated.)

A: I think it lacks sufficient knowledge of some common sense aspects. (For example, when I ask it to draw the human body, it may not have a clear understanding of human organs and might sometimes draw a combination of male and female features.)

Q: What kind of assistance do you hope future AI drawing tools could provide you in terms of prompt optimization?

A: Perhaps it could have associations like "guess what I like," giving me some options to choose the next direction for modifying the prompt. Or it could understand that I need to draw a specific project, and I want it to maintain a consistent style while drawing that project.
