1. Could you share some information about your background, position, and research area?

    I am currently studying at Capital Normal University, in the third year of my master's program. My research focus is primarily on the prediction of spatial interaction.

2. Generally speaking, what is your purpose in conducting an academic paper search?

    Firstly, during the early stages of my research, I need to read a large number of papers related to my field to explore research directions that personally interest me.

    After completing the first stage, the second stage involves narrowing down from a broad perspective to a specific point. In other words, once I have identified a relatively definite research direction, I need to search for more specialized papers within that specific area, as well as innovative points, to use as references.

    Finally, during the writing stage, it is necessary to find papers that support my methods and research approach.

3. How frequently do you search for research papers during your work?

    Actually, this is quite concentrated. When needed, I will conduct a focused search.

4. Typically, what tools do you use for academic paper searches?

    The main platform I use is Google Scholar.

5. Can you introduce some of the advantages you think of this tool you mentioned?

    Firstly, the biggest advantage is that it's free.

    Secondly, Google Scholar's paper repository feels the most comprehensive and extensive compared to other tools. It includes journals, books, and conference papers.

6. Can you be more specific? For example, in terms of functionality, what is your experience with precision in keyword searches and other indicators?

    In terms of sensory perception, I feel that Google Scholar delivers the best search results. Since my research area is relatively niche, many times search results include articles from other directions. Typically, when I search for keywords related to my research field on Google Scholar, 2-3 of the articles on the first page of search results are what I need. In contrast, with other search tools, I might need to go through 2-3 pages of results to find one relevant article.

7. And any disadvantages you think ? 

    I haven't really thought about it much; I feel there aren't any particularly noticeable drawbacks for now.

8. What is the biggest challenges you face in the current paper discovery process ?

    Perhaps the most significant challenge lies firstly in the fact that many papers cannot be directly downloaded and accessed; often, access requires payment of high fees.

    Secondly, in terms of functionality, the challenge may lie in the difficulty of filtering search results after conducting a paper search. However, I think this is a challenging issue to avoid because, in reality, a single keyword can correspond to various academic fields. It does require us to spend time further refining the search results.

9. With the continuous development of AI and large language model technology, have you heard of some paper search tools based on AI or large language model ?

    I haven't come across that, but I have heard of some AI-based tools designed to assist with reading papers. They can quickly help you summarize paper abstracts and provide similar functionalities, assisting in your paper reading.

10. How important do you think the visualization type in research results ?

    I think it's still very important. When you mention "visualization" here, what specifically do you mean? Could you please explain?

11. For example, Google Scholar presents results in a list format, but some tools display search results by constructing a graph based on citation relationships. Do you think this kind of visual representation is important?

    Yes, I've also heard of a method that connects various papers in search results through keywords, ultimately presenting them in a graphical format. I believe that this type of visualization can, to some extent, enhance the efficiency of users in filtering and conducting secondary searches.

11. What type of visualizations do you find most helpful in understanding and organizing research results.

    I think it depends on the purpose of my paper search. For example, as I mentioned earlier, in the first stage, when I conduct a broad search, a list display format may be more suitable. However, once I have identified my research direction, some visualizations like relationship graphs might be better. They can effectively showcase the current research hotspots and trends.
