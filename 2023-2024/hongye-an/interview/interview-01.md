​

1. Could you share some information about your background, position, and research area ?

    I am currently studying for a master's degree at the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. I am in the process of completing my master's thesis, and my research focuses on the security and defense of recommendation systems.

2. Generally speaking, what is your purpose in conducting an academic paper search ?

    Recently, because of I've been primarily working on my graduation design project. I hope to search for some relevant literature to use as references, providing ideas for completing my graduation project or drawing inspiration from research methods in related papers.

3. How frequently do you search for research papers during your work ?

    This may not necessarily depend on what my recent work is. I have just started preparing for my project recently, and I spend about half a day on this work every week. Because I need to find some inspiration and research directions for my graduation design project


4. Typically, what tools do you use for academic paper searches ?
    
    Google Scholar

5. Can you introduce some of the advantages you think of this tool you mentioned?

    First, I think Google Scholar’s data is very comprehensive. it indexes a wide range of scholarly content, including articles, theses, books, conference papers etc. It provides extensive coverage across various disciplines.

    Next it's free to use, this is also a very important advantage.

    The last point is that Google Scholar can be linked to the researcher's homepage. On this homepage, you can see all the papers of the researcher, which is also very convenient.

6. And any disadvantages you think ? 

    The primary disadvantage I think is that when I search by keywords, many articles in the results may have the relevant keywords in the body, but the overall content may not be closely related to the direction I want to study.

    In addition, the related search function of Google Scholar is not very user-friendly. If I find a paper related to my research area, it is difficult for me to search for papers similar to this one in some way.

7. Have you used https://www.connectedpapers.com/ for academic paper retrieval work? This platform can visually display the connections between papers through various charts.

    Certainly, but I feel that tool has certain limitations. To a large extent, it showcases the relationships between papers through citation connections. Additionally, I sense that its database is not as comprehensive as Google Scholar. Therefore, at present, I still primarily use Google Scholar for paper searches.

8. What is the biggest challenges you face in the current paper discovery process ?

    Because of my current biggest need is to find some papers that are consistent with my research direction. The biggest challenge for me is may that It is difficult and usually requires a lot of searching and browsing, which takes a long time.

9. According to the previous question, can you share how long it took you and how many papers you read to find a suitable paper recently?

    Ok, it took me about 4-5 hours. I browsed about 2 pages of Google Scholar search results and about 20 papers. Mainly by browsing the abstract of the paper, if the abstract content is more in line with my research direction, I will continue to look at the paper in depth, and finally find a paper that relatively meets my expectations.

10. With the continuous development of AI and large language model technology, have you heard of some paper search tools based on AI or large language model ?
    
    No, not yet. I haven't used it, I think GPT-4 has opened up plugin functionality. I speculate that there might be relevant plugins for paper retrieval, which could be helpful for paper searches.

11. How important do you think the visualization type in research results ?

    I think the way search results are displayed is still crucial to the efficiency of searching and paper organization. Because reasonable UI design and data display methods will make the results more intuitive, so that make complex information more accessible and easier to understand.

    Then, certain visualizations can facilitate comparative analysis between different papers, authors, or journals. This is particularly useful for researchers trying to evaluate the impact of specific works or assess the productivity of authors.

12. What type of visualizations do you find most helpful in understanding and organizing research results.

    Maybe network graphs and keyword tag clouds could be most helpful.

    Network graphs often reveal clusters or communities within the academic landscape. It could illustrate relationships between various entities, it's a good way to show the correlation between different papers.

    Keyword tag clouds could visually highlight the most frequently occurring keywords in a set of search results. We can quickly identify important terms that are prevalent in my interesting field.

13. For the network diagram you mentioned in the previous question, what specific presentation form do you mean?

    I think one is similar to the network graph we mentioned before that can be used to show reference relationships.
    
    Secondly is a network graph that can show text similarity between each other.

    The last possibility maybe a network graph that shows the similarity between the article and the user's search text.
