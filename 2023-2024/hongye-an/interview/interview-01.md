Q: What has been the general nature of your recent demands for literature searches?

A: Recently, I've been primarily working on my graduation design project. I hope to search for some relevant literature to use as references, providing ideas for completing my graduation project or drawing inspiration from research methods in related papers.

Q: Typically, what tools do you use for academic paper searches?

A: Google Scholar

Q: When using Google Scholar for paper searches, what is the biggest pain point for you ?

A: The primary pain point is that when I search by keywords, many articles in the results may have the relevant keywords in the body, but the overall content may not be closely related to the direction I want to study. This leads to spending a significant amount of time browsing and filtering through the search results.

In addition, the related search function of Google Scholar is not very user-friendly. If I find a paper related to my research area, it is difficult for me to search for papers similar to this one in some way.

Q: Have you used https://www.connectedpapers.com/ for academic paper retrieval work? This platform can visually display the connections between papers through various charts.

A: Certainly, but I feel that tool has certain limitations. To a large extent, it showcases the relationships between papers through citation connections. Additionally, I sense that its database is not as comprehensive as Google Scholar. Therefore, at present, I still primarily use Google Scholar for paper searches.

Q: Have you tried using AI tools such as ChatGPT or other AI products to assist you in your paper searches?

A: No, not yet. I haven't used it, I think GPT-4 has opened up plugin functionality. I speculate that there might be relevant plugins for paper retrieval, which could be helpful for paper searches.

Q: Can you proposed any feature points that would meet your needs for my project?

A: I hope to enhance the functionality of related searches, meanwhile itâ€™s preferably in a visually intuitive way for users. Unlike search engines like Google Scholar that display results in a list format, it would be ideal to visualize the results in an intuitive manner.
