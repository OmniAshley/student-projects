Issues encountered by researchers in the literature retrieval process:

    - Some keyword-based search tools may yield inaccurate results, leading to potential illusions. For instance, certain keywords may have different meanings in various academic disciplines.
    - Researchers often spend a significant amount of time reviewing each paper in the search results to determine if it aligns with their objectives.
    - The visualization of results in some paper retrieval tools is presented in a list format, which may not effectively showcase the interrelatedness and relevance among different papers.
