1. Provide a user interface and interactive logic based on a conversational format, where users can engage in a "dialogue" with the application by posing queries such as "Help me find papers related to data visualization" or "Summarize what the content of this paper is about." This dialogue approach facilitates the retrieval of relevant papers from a specific research database.

2. Visualize the results of paper queries in the form of a relational network graph, allowing users to easily retrieve and explore academically similar papers with a high degree of textual coherence.
