## Desgin Requirements

1. Innovation: The cornerstone of CHAT-ACADEMIC is to pioneer a novel approach to literature retrieval. The essence of this innovation lies in introducing a conversation-based interaction method, setting the system apart from traditional query-based search engines. This method hinges on understanding and engaging with users through contextual dialog, allowing the system to grasp the nuances of user queries beyond mere keywords. It aims to mimic a natural, human-like conversation, adapting to the user's needs and questions in real time. To accomplish this, our system will leverage cutting-edge LLM techniques to interpret, respond, and learn from the context of the conversation. 

2. Functionality: The functionality objectives of CHAT-ACADEMIC encompass the following aspects: 1. To transcend the traditional keyword search paradigm by facilitating semantic searches of related literature. 2. To chronicle the history of usersâ€™ literature search dialogues. 3. To offer a web-based user interface. 4. To visually present the results of literature searches.

3. Visualization: A vital component of enhancing user experience in literature search is visualization. CHAT-ACADEMIC intends to incorporate a sophisticated visualization interface, particularly when the user's input pertains to a request for literature search. Through this interface, the semantic relationships among the search results will be visually embodied in the form of a 2-D network node graph. Each node in this graph represents a piece of literature, nodes with the same color represent similar semantics. Meanwhile, the paper retrieved results obtained from the search are displayed in the form of a list view, and interactive effects are added to the relationship network diagram and academic paper list view. This visual representation will enable users to intuitively navigate through the corpus of literature, uncover patterns and relationships they might not have noticed, and ultimately, facilitate a deeper understanding of the subject matter at hand.
