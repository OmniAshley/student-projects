# Project Ideas

1. Implementing an academic paper retrieval project is required to support not only conventional information searches, such as author, year, keywords, etc., but also to facilitate relevance searches. For example, it should be able to query semantically related papers based on semantic similarity.

2. Utilize graphical and visual means to display search results, such as association graphs or diagrams, providing an intuitive representation of the relationships between papers. Display the relevance scores for each paper in the search results, assisting users in identifying the most relevant papers.
