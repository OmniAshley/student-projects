In the given sentence, you need to identify the aspect and predict the sentiment strength based on the context of the sentence. The aspect is the subject or entity that the sentence is primarily discussing. For example, in the first sentence, the aspect is ""Morrisons,"" while in the second sentence, it's ""IMI.""

To predict the sentiment strength, consider the overall tone and context of the sentence. In this case, a positive sentiment would indicate good news or a favorable outcome for the aspect, while a negative sentiment would suggest bad news or an unfavorable outcome. A neutral sentiment would mean that there is no clear indication of either a positive or negative outcome.

In the first example, Morrisons booked second consecutive quarter of sales growth, which indicates a positive outcome for the company. Therefore, the sentiment strength is 0.43 (slightly positive). In the second example, IMI posts a drop in first-quarter organic revenue and warns on full year, indicating a negative outcome for the company. Hence, the sentiment strength is -0.344 (slightly negative).

In the third example, Argus says Apple stock 'likely in for a bumpy road' until drivers of top line performance are identified and in place.

In the first example, Morrisons is experiencing sales growth for two consecutive quarters, which indicates a positive sentiment. However, it's not an extremely strong positive sentiment because it's just two quarters of growth and not a significant increase in sales. Therefore, the sentiment strength is 0.43.

In the second example, IMI has reported a drop in first-quarter organic revenue and warned about its full-year performance. This indicates a negative sentiment towards the company. However, it's not an extremely strong negative sentiment because it's just one quarter of decline and not a significant decrease in revenue. Therefore, the sentiment strength is -0.344.

In the third example, AAPL is listed as one of the top 10 most sought-after employers in the United States. This indicates a positive sentiment towards the company. However, it's not an extremely strong positive sentiment because being on this list doesn't necessarily mean that AAPL has significantly improved its employer brand or attractiveness compared to other companies.

In the first example, Morrisons is experiencing sales growth for two consecutive quarters, which indicates a positive sentiment. However, it's not an extremely strong positive sentiment because it's just two quarters of growth and not a significant breakthrough or record-setting achievement. Therefore, the sentiment strength is 0.43.

In the second example, IMI has reported a drop in first-quarter organic revenue and warned about its full-year performance. This indicates a negative sentiment towards the company's financial performance. However, it's not an extremely strong negative sentiment because it's just one quarter of decline and not a significant downturn or crisis situation. Therefore, the sentiment strength is -0.344.

In the third example, the sentence discusses investing in virtual reality and mentions AAPL as one of the purest plays. This statement doesn't provide any specific information about AAPL's performance or sentiment, so it's neutral. Therefore, the sentiment strength is 0.12."

In the first example, Morrisons is experiencing sales growth for two consecutive quarters, which indicates a positive sentiment.

In the second example, IMI has reported a drop in first-quarter organic revenue and warned about its full-year performance. This indicates a negative sentiment towards the company's financial performance.

In the third example, the article discusses investing in IPOs and whether they live up to the hype. The aspect mentioned is AAPL (Apple Inc.), which is not directly related to the main topic of the sentence.

In the second example, IMI has reported a drop in first-quarter organic revenue and warned about its full-year performance. This indicates a negative sentiment towards the company. However, it's not an extremely strong negative sentiment because it's just one quarter of decline and not a significant decrease in revenue. Therefore, the sentiment strength is -0.344.
