Interview Questions and Answers

Participant1 （Have art-related experience）

Q1: Have you ever used or are you considering using GPT or similar natural language processing tools as a tool for creating art?
A1: Yes.

Q2: GPT ever been used to generate text descriptions or artist statements for artworks? If yes, please share your experiences.
A2: YES. It is usually used first to get a template for reference to get an idea of what these texts or statements, roughly, need to cover. Then it will go one of two ways: first, I'll just need what I want to cover and have it write one first, and I'll make changes and additions based on what he's written. This method allows for a collaborative effort between the AI model and my creative input, resulting in a more customized and nuanced output.
The second approach involves me independently crafting the text descriptions or artist statements. Following this, GPT is employed as a tool for refinement, primarily focusing on rectifying grammar or enhancing vocabulary. By leveraging the model in this manner, I ensure that the final text not only maintains coherence and clarity but also adheres to grammatical conventions and employs a rich vocabulary.

Q3: How do you use GPT to get inspiration or support for your artwork?
A3: I usually have a topic or a direction that I want to do, and then I will ask GPT what he associates with the topic or direction from various angles, and then see if there are any points that he has overlooked or never thought of in terms of surviving the content, or maybe I can get some new ideas from those reasons or something else, and then I will go deeper into it.
To derive inspiration or support for my artwork using GPT, I typically start with a specific topic or a general direction in mind. I engage GPT by posing inquiries related to the chosen theme, prompting the model to provide its associations and perspectives from various angles. This approach allows me to tap into the vast knowledge and creativity embedded in the model, gaining insights that might not have occurred to me initially.
As GPT responds with its associations, I carefully examine the input to identify any aspects it may have overlooked or novel ideas that I may not have considered regarding the content of my artwork. The collaborative interaction with the model serves as a catalyst for exploring uncharted territories within my creative process.
The exploration doesn't stop at the initial responses; rather, it serves as a springboard for delving deeper into the suggested concepts. I leverage these newfound perspectives to stimulate my own creative thinking and to enhance the richness and depth of my artwork. This iterative process of interaction with GPT not only broadens the scope of my ideas but also fuels the creative evolution of my artistic endeavors.

Q4: Has GPT provided you with new creative perspectives? Please share a specific example.
A4: For example, if the topic is a fruit or vegetable, I asked GPT what he could associate with it, and also from his historical point of view, to find out where the vegetable originated and when it came to the UK, and then use this as one of the directions to think about how his history can be related to some contemporary topics.
The information retrieved from GPT's responses served as a valuable catalyst for broadening my thinking. By incorporating historical insights into my creative process, I found a unique avenue to explore connections between the vegetable's past and contemporary topics. This approach not only added depth to my artistic contemplation but also introduced layers of meaning that might have been overlooked without GPT's contribution.

Q5: Have you faced technical challenges when using GPT? What was the biggest challenge?
A5: I think the biggest challenge is how to issue commands with precise words or expressions to get what you want, that is, it will often happen that although you may have entered a whole bunch of commands, what you get is not what you want, and then the main thing is to try several times before you may be able to find a more appropriate one. The crux of the issue lies in the nuanced nature of language and the intricacies of communication. GPT's response can be sensitive to slight variations in phrasing, requiring a degree of trial and error to pinpoint the most effective way to phrase a command. This iterative process involves refining the input language and experimenting with different expressions until a more suitable outcome is obtained.

Q6: How do you think GPT has been influential in expanding an artist's creative field or style during the creative process?
A6: I think it mainly serves as a guide and a stimulus to help me think more deeply about the subject matter, and then get inspired by more perspectives. Moreover, the content of the creation will not be so superficial, and through his inspiration and guidance, the artist will be able to explore more deeply and study the theme from multiple angles, so that the artwork will carry the artist's own thinking and expression.
By acting as a guide, GPT facilitates a more profound contemplation of the chosen themes. The model's responses offer insights and associations that may not have been immediately apparent, prompting the artist to consider diverse viewpoints. This not only enhances the depth of conceptualization but also encourages a more comprehensive exploration of the chosen themes.
Moreover, GPT's influence goes beyond surface-level creativity. Through its inspiration and guidance, the artist is prompted to explore the subject matter from multiple angles. This comprehensive approach allows for a more thorough examination of the theme, resulting in artwork that reflects the artist's nuanced thinking and distinctive expression.

Participant2 （Have design-related experience)

Q1: Have you faced technical challenges when using GPT? What was the biggest challenge?
A1: I recalled my use of GPT in my studies and realised that there was a real problem. It was that many times when I was using it, there was a mismatch between the instructions I entered and the images and text he presented. For example, if I wanted him to provide me with an image of an ancient style mood, he couldn't understand the needed mood very well. Despite entering clear instructions, GPT's interpretation sometimes fell short, leading to outcomes that did not align with the intended aesthetic or mood. The challenge lay in bridging the gap between the specificity of my instructions and the nuanced understanding required by the model to generate contextually fitting content.
In essence, the biggest challenge revolved around refining the communication between myself and the model to ensure a more accurate and aligned interpretation of the instructions, particularly when seeking specific moods or visual styles. Addressing this challenge often involved experimenting with different phrasings and instructions to enhance the model's comprehension and, consequently, improve the quality of the generated output.

Q2: How do you think GPT has been influential in expanding an artist's creative field or style during the creative process?
A2: I believe that GPT plays a significant role in expanding an artist's creative field and influencing their artistic style throughout the creative process. In the image creation process, GPT leverages a vast repository of data encompassing various styles from numerous artists. Through an intricate analysis of these diverse artistic styles, GPT combines elements from different works to generate unique images. Essentially, GPT encapsulates within its capabilities a mosaic of styles that have already been explored by various artists.
