Interview Questions and Answers

Q1: Have you ever used or are you considering using GPT or similar natural language processing tools as a tool for creating art?
A1: Yes.

Q2: GPT ever been used to generate text descriptions or artist statements for artworks? If yes, please share experiences.
A2: YES. It is usually used first to get a template for reference to get an idea of what these texts or statements, roughly, need to cover. Then it will go one of two ways: first, I'll just need what I want to cover and have it write one first, and I'll make changes and additions based on what he's written. The second, I'll just write it myself and then use it to correct the grammar or vocabulary of my text.

Q3: How do you use GPT to get inspiration or support for your artwork?
A3: I usually have a topic or a direction that I want to do, and then I will ask GPT what he associates with the topic or direction from various angles, and then see if there are any points that he has overlooked or never thought of in terms of surviving the content, or maybe I can get some new ideas from those reasons or something else, and then I will go deeper into it.

Q4: Has GPT provided you with new creative perspectives? Please share a specific example.
A4: For example, if the topic is a fruit or vegetable, I asked GPT what he could associate with it, and also from his historical point of view, to find out where the vegetable originated and when it came to the UK, and then use this as one of the directions to think about how his history can be related to some contemporary topics.

Q5: Have you faced technical challenges when using GPT? What was the biggest challenge?
A5: I think the biggest challenge is how to issue commands with precise words or expressions to get what you want, that is, it will often happen that although you may have entered a whole bunch of commands, what you get is not what you want, and then the main thing is to try several times before you may be able to find a more appropriate one.

Q6: How do you think GPT has been influential in expanding an artist's creative field or style during the creative process?
A6: I think it mainly serves as a guide and a stimulus to help me think more deeply about the subject matter, and then get inspired by more perspectives. Moreover, the content of the creation will not be so superficial, and through his inspiration and guidance, the artist will be able to explore more deeply and study the theme from multiple angles, so that the artwork will carry the artist's own thinking and expression.
