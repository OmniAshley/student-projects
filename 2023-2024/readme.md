# 14 May 2024
Hongye

1. Progress:
   - Working with the dissertation.
   - Try to deploy Vitality2 to the online environment.

2. Question:

2. Question: none
3. Next steps: finish analysing testing, complete the diss first draft and get feedback


Jiaqi
1. Progress:
   - integrate Azure api in prototype
   - add a task summarize functionality
   - connected with 4 users, completed the training session
   - conducted 1 user test
2. Question:
   - ada embedding model doesn't have corresponding Javascript SDK
   - the design of user test:
      - provide 2 set of tasks, each set with 2 tasks. 
         
         for example: 
         
         set 1:{task1: make a simple travel plan to Tailand; task2: what is the cause of aurora, what value can be used to predict it?}

         set 2:{task1: make a simple travel plan to Scotland; task2: what is ADHD,find the general cause of it and therapy advice.}
      - user need to search for set1 as usually, and provide a breif search result
      - for set2, user need to use extension
      - compare the browsing time, tab count and final result
3. next step
   - conduct user test and result analysis

# 7 May 2024
Rachana
1. progress
   - finished debugging and last additions to website (fix issues with page refreshing and buttons not triggering correctly, made home page describing the website's features w/ screenshots of examples)
   - hosted the prototype website up on pythonanywhere ([link]((https://rachana99.pythonanywhere.com/)))
   - read 2 research papers suggested by kai - my study design was inspired by the anglekindling paper
   - completed the user study & evaluation design
   - finished recruiting participants: 5 hobbyist writers (mainly students or fresh graduates who enjoy writing in free time), 1 professional writer (poet w/ multiple publications and awards who is working on a novel)
   - completed 3 user testing sessions
2. question: i already did half of the testing so i think it is too late to change the study design but are there are changes i should make in how i evaluate the responses from the users? 
3. next step
- do another 3 user testing sessions
- transcribe all 6 testing sessions and do a thematic analysis/evaluate the testing
- outline dissertation and start writing first draft


# 30 Apr 2024
Jiaqi
1. progress
   - utilise t-sne for dimension reduction
   - using a new package to extract main contant
   - analysis the outcome of t-sne
2. question
   - t-sne doesn't have good performance for similarity match
   - WebAssembly run time error
3. next step
   - try to use PCA
   - start user test

Rachana
1. progress
   - Added storyboard templates for five act structure and hero's journey
   - Combined image generation with plot idea generation so the user will see an image that illustrates the plot idea. Also made it possible for user to add the plot idea to the storyboard directly by clicking a button.
2. question
   - Storing the image data in local storage is actually making the application slow - this wasn't an issue during the informal testing because I asked the user to upload images as the last step. Do I need to fix this issue or can I just leave it (I think the solution will involve changing how I store data which will take time)? 
4. next step
   - finish debugging (fix issues with page refreshing), save plot ideas and associated image data to JSON file, plan the user testing & evaluation

3. Next step
   - grouping behavior(color change/add in node container automatically)
   - continu dissertation writing

Hongye

  - Meet some difficulty in forntend development, populating the RAG result into Vitality visualization graph and list.

3. next step
   - Discuss with VITALITY team to get some feedback and advice.

Rachana
1. Progress:
   - sort of fixed the character consistency in multiple images issue (but it is dependent on how much detail user provides when filling out form) => i'm doing this by tracking the prompts submitted to gpt-4 in a separate json file so it has context about how it edited previous prompts for image generation
   - did informal user testing with one friend for 1.5 hours + asked questions at the end  
   - added nav bar, the order of scenes in storyboard are also saved in localstorage now
   - set up plot ideas generation based on the storyboard content and/or additional form data from user
3. Question: is 6-8 users sufficient for the prototype testing?
4. Next step: finish summarising user testing session, use feedback to improve the MVP, switch to azure api

Jianwen

Rachana
1. Progress: asked 4 people to do formal user testing & found 1 person to do user testing informally this week, testing out redesigning prompts to improve character consistency with better results, figured out how to make sure dall e api only minimally edits prompts, the dalle 2 api requires user to submit a mask for parts of image to edit and this process seemed a little complicated so i think it will be best to stick with prompting
2. Questions: none
3. Next step: implementing the prompt design changes that i think will work better, adding plot generation functionality to storyboard, informal testing

Jianwen
1. Progress:
   - Refined structures after adding new model components.

3. Next Step:
   - integrate transformer.js

# 2 Apr 2024
Jianwen
1. Progress:
   - finished the auto-cell finding function.
   - fixed the display problem.
   - added code-cell function, user can right-click code cell for adding a component, this component can be deleted.
   - added notes function, user can add notes under one component, this note will be stored to backend.
   - for Graph-Display, found some Graph-related libraries: D3.js, Chart.js, jsPlumb, GoJS, Mermaid... 
2. Question:
   - which library to choose (may have no time for testing all of them).
   - graph view as a seperate panel?
   - for dataflow graphic view, we need to find "where data loading is", "where feature engineering is", ..., do we need stuff like LLM to do that?
   - compatibility of Graphics Lib with @Lumino
3. Next Step:

Rachana
1. Progress:
   - tested different prompting strategies in openai playground
   - set up the image generation page with multiple rounds of prompt processing with gpt-4 (character description, image preferences summary, and overall prompt refinement) + generating images with dall e 3 + saving data to json files
   - tried out user flow for the page (filling out forms etc) but unfortunately, the character looks too different in each image
3. Question: can't find a solution for stopping dall e api from editing the prompt (this is an issue since i want to use similar prompts to get consistent character generation). and i also can't get the API to generate similar looking characters even with the whole prompt editing workflow i set up so i'm not really sure how to fix this.
4. Next step: trying to make the character look more similar in each image so the images are useful for storyboarding, figure out how to prevent api from editing prompts, try out editing images with dall e 2 api, do quick informal user testing

Ziyue
1. Progress:
   - finished some page development
   - continue on the codes and then debugging

   - try to finish the web part and the GPT/LSTM comparsion part

Jiaqi 
1. Progress:
   - explore webpack, which allow us use outside package.
   - modulise the code, add a new dict for data storage.

3. Next step:
   - enable simple feature with transformer.js.
   - considering new feature instead of archive: open all the pages from one task in new window when user click a button.
   - continue the modulization.

Hongye
1. progress:
   - Work with the interim report (progress: 50%), expect to finish the first edition and request review by next Wednesday.
