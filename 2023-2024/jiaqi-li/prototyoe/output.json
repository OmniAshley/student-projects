    "Denser_Summary": "This article outlines the mechanics behind large language models (LLMs), sophisticated AI programs capable of processing and generating human language by being trained on extensive data sets derived from vast resources such as the internet. The training process involves the application of deep learning techniques to analyze unstructured data, enabling these models to understand how words and sentences operate collectively. Additionally, LLMs undergo a fine-tuning process tailored to the specific task at hand, such as language translation or response generation to prompts or questions."

    "Denser_Summary": "LLMs, employing deep learning for nuanced understanding of textual structures from vast unstructured data sets, are tailored for diverse tasks through fine-tuning. One such application is demonstrated through OpenAI's LLM, ChatGPT, proficient in generating high-quality texts such as essays or poems on user prompts. Furthermore, LLMs have been trained on complex data sets like programming languages, aiding coders by crafting functions or completing codes. These capabilities of LLMs extend to intricate domains such as DNA research, highlighting their versatile potentials."

    "Missing_Entities": "Bugs & security issues; LLMs' hallucination; user confidential data",
    "Denser_Summary": "Deep learning-enriched LLMs like ChatGPT and code-helping models are fine-tuned for various duties, including responding to prompts and dissecting complex data such as genetics. However, these LLMs carry their own baggage of challenges. Despite their unmatched versatility, they endure common application issues, exhibiting bugs and security flaws. Paradoxically, their strength of free-form comprehension can lead to 'hallucination', generating misleading or inaccurate information. Lastly, while many users can unwittingly expose their sensitive data to augment LLM capabilities, these models lack secure data handling, potentially leaking pertinent details."
