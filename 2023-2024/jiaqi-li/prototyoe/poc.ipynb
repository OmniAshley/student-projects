    "- Faithful: present in the Article.\n",

    "- The first summary should be long (4-5 sentences, 120 words) yet highly non-specific, containing little information beyond the entities marked as missing. Use overly verbose language and fillers (e.g., \"this article discusses\") to reach ~80 words.\n",
    "- Make every word count: rewrite the previous summary to improve flow and make space for additional entities.\n",
    "- Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases like \"the article discusses\".\n",
    "- The summaries should become highly dense and concise yet self-contained, e.g., easily understood without the Article.\n",
    "- Missing entities can appear anywhere in the new summary.\n",
    "- Never drop entities from the previous summary. If space cannot be made, add fewer new entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, use the exact same number of words for each summary.\n",
