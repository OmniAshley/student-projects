### follow up interview：

follow q4: 
      - What kind information could be helpful for you to navigate to specific website when needed? **There are only brife title in history log. It would be better if there are more detail information, for example, when I am searching for publication, I can see the journal name, some abstract, keyword, or famous author, something like this.**

- As you said, there are some title of paper are similay and have same keywords, but can you tell the difference of them? and if you are allow to customize how information is displayed in the history log for better organization, what will you put in title？ 
**Yes I can tell them after I read the abstract. In my collection folder, I usually put papers in one scope in a same folder, and give them serial numbers. Then I will put journal name and brief summary.**

- When you do a wilder research, how did you collect information? if you want to propose a new research idea to your supervisor? 
**I usually use note to organize the collected information。I might firstly put the URL in, and extract some important information manully and put beside of the link.**

- A new use case: When I need to intorduce some flow, mind map can be very useful. This is more like a step-by-step guide. the flow chart need to follow teh sequence. 

- What kind of information do you need for understanding other's sensemaking process? 
      **- I think a list with information can be helpful. Take travel planning as an example, if you recommend other's search processes about travel to Japan, there are several categories: hotel(price, location), traffic (time, duration, price), restaurant (need a reservation or not, price, cuisine type). With all this detailed information, I can decide whether this person's decision suits me or not.**
      **- consider the academic scenario. Connected papers are useful, the graph and connection are based on reference relations. In some journal web pages, they might recommend 3 other papers and claim that these papers have similar content to the current paper. But these recommendations are not reliable. Because this is just based on narrow keywords. If I could see other user's reading after this current paper, this would probably interest me.**
