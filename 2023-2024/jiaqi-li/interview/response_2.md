2.	Do you usually use history log to trace back to any pages you browsed？
**A: Yes, I did trace back around once in 3 days**
3.	Is there any difficult for you to find specific webpage in history log?
**A: Yes, the webpage sometimes is difficult to be fetched by keywords, in history log, it only has title of the webpage and link. Some times I browsed several pages under one site, they didn't seems any difference in history log. So I need to scroll and scan the history of that day.**
4.	Do you usually group your tabs in browser to make it easier to navigate to certain pages?
**A: I did bookmark websites and category them as “Search Engine”, “Translate”, “Shopping”, “Useful in Research” something like that. But I didn’t do other navigation grouping.**
5.	If you do, could you introduce your logic of grouping?
**A: I usually group them by function, as I mentioned ealier. Among them the website about living like ”Anime”, “Movie”, “Receipe”, “Travel” are too many so they are categorized in a big folder called ”Living”. Besides, some current ongoing event may grouped together, like “England Conference”, all the conference website, hotel, visa and related websites are concluded together.**

**A: For example, I made a conference presentation in England, during the 3 weeks before going and 1 week after coming back, those websites of conference information, air ticket and hotel, Visa need to be confirmed, followed and printed many times, for ensuring the information and make material for reimbersement. Without this grouping tabse I would search on Google or history every time waste much more time, since they are not close related websites.**
7.	In terms of organizing and categorizing tasks, how important is customization to you?
**A: I think the usual organizing tools based on basic categories like “working”, “movie”, “shopping”, but I need tags for coping different situation like some urgent task and important but not urgent task. Besides I may start some instant tabs like searching some material during meeting or answering some question to others, in these case I’d like some automatic tabs recognize what I am doing generally, as I would have no time for editing the tag and may want to look back at next time meeting.**
8.	Do you have demand to deliver your search result to other people?
**A: Yes, I sometimes do the cooperation to tackle on same problem or topic, when we want to share our findings, we can only share the links one by one through SNS media. If I want to summarize a set of search result like the comparison of different companies product, or a list of relative researches, I always have to paste all the URL together and some of them are too long to make the form structured.**
9.	How do you gather information from webpage and generate deliverable content？
**A: I copy paste the usable information one by one together. If I need to conclude a report, I will pick up keywords and resentence by typing.**
10.	Can you describe a recent situation where you had to manage multiple tasks simultaneously? How did you go about organizing your browser tabs to handle these tasks?
**A: I always proceed multiple tasks. For example I am searching articles to solve my research problem, but I spent 2 hours searching in Google scholar and read papers and still can not find the answer, so I just turn to my report homework, I just leave those tabs open and start more new tabs, and I didn’t finish report when dinner time, I will leave the tabs and start watching movie while eating. Maybe the next day I will start with all above task, but sometime I just choose to abondon all tabs before shutting them down and start searching again, as the computer become heaveir and slower.**

New use case: 
In scenarios where there are various scopes of searching, all related to a common task, such as organizing useful webpage for a conference in England, users often need to track diverse elements like conference websites, flight tickets, and travel plans. These items may belong to different categories, making it challenging for a simple algorithm to automatically recognize and group them together. Therefore we chould provides enhanced flexibility, allowing users to customize and define their own groups. This way, users can tailor the organization of their information according to the specific needs of their tasks.
