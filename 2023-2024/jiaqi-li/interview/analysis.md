2. The issue of current browser functionality
    - Limited Information in History Log: It can be frustrating when the history log only displays the title of web pages, especially when the titles are not distinctive. Some subtitles are not showing further compounds the problem, making it difficult to differentiate between similar-looking links.
    - Tab Grouping in Google Chrome: While Google Chrome offers tab grouping options, the process can be time-consuming and may require a good understanding of webpage content. This feature might not be as intuitive or efficient for users who open many tabs regularly.
    - Narrow Tabs When Many Are Open: The issue of tabs becoming too narrow to display full titles is a common problem, especially for users who open a large number of tabs simultaneously. This makes it challenging for users to identify and switch between tabs based on their titles quickly.
    - History log can be chaotic easily when dealing with multiple tasks simultaneously. For example, 10 tabs are opening for 3 different tasks, even though users are consistent with one task when they click on another tab accidentally, the browser will record it as a new log. 
    - Certain users exhibit skepticism towards recommendations from websites. They find that these recommendations are often based on specific keywords and may not perfectly align with the current topic of interest. As a result, users prefer relying on their own judgment and exploration rather than solely depending on automated suggestions.

3. User Behaviour
    - Users tend to bookmark webpages that they consider important or valuable for different purposes, such as research, entertainment, or frequent use.
    > This indicates a desire to prioritize and easily access specific content without relying solely on the browser's history or tab management.
    - Some user have needs of deliver search result or search content to other people. Their usual approach is copy paste the link in notebook or world document, and manyally summarise the important keypoint of the webpage, and also give a brife name of the webpage. 
    - When attempting to comprehend the content in their browsing history or understand someone else's thought process, users tend to prefer a clear flowchart or summarization for each step. This reflects a desire for organized and easily digestible information.
    - Users find it easy to understand when there are few records in the history log. Common keywords in the title make it obvious for the user to grasp the person's intent or topic.
    - However, when it comes to multitask, when the topic changes rapidly, it's challenging for user to catch up. when there are unfamilary words or concept appear in title, it's even harder to follow up. 
    - A large number of records in the history log overwhelm users. They are easily lost patience and believe it's hard to understand even thought the topic is concise. 
    - Users tend to ignore small parts about other tasks when history logs are filled with links and information about different topics. The cluttered nature of the log makes it hard for users to focus on specific information.

4. User requirement
    1. Tab Recognition
        - In scenarios where users need to open instant tabs during meetings or while providing quick responses to others, there's a desire for automatic tab recognition. Users often lack time to manually edit tags, and they want the extension to intelligently identify and categorize the content of these tabs. This feature aims to provide efficient task organization, enabling users to easily revisit and reference relevant information from previous instant tab sessions during subsequent meetings or tasks.
        - In another scenario, users need to deal with several task at same time or in same window. It require our extension to recognise the content for downstream steop such as task grouping. 
    2.  Content Summarization
        - A high-level, breif summary for each website and entile task can be helpful for user to follow the thinking process represented by history log or website list.
