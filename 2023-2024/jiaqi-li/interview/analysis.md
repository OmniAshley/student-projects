2. The issue of current browser functionality
    - Limited Information in History Log: It can be frustrating when the history log only displays the title of web pages, especially when the titles are not distinctive. Some subtitles are not showing further compounds the problem, making it difficult to differentiate between similar-looking links.
    - Tab Grouping in Google Chrome: While Google Chrome offers tab grouping options, the process can be time-consuming and may require a good understanding of webpage content. This feature might not be as intuitive or efficient for users who open many tabs regularly.
    - Narrow Tabs When Many Are Open: The issue of tabs becoming too narrow to display full titles is a common problem, especially for users who open a large number of tabs simultaneously. This makes it challenging for users to identify and switch between tabs based on their titles quickly.
    - History log can be chaotic easily when dealing with multiple tasks simultaneously. For example, 10 tabs are opening for 3 different tasks, even though users are consistent with one task when they click on another tab accidentally, the browser will record it as a new log.
