Project Plan: Generative AI for Writers

Introduction

This master’s research project will explore using generative models to assist fiction writers. Generative image models such as Stable Diffusion [1] are trained to denoise images with guidance from prompts, thereby producing new images [2].  Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3, generate text and carry out tasks such as writing code and autocompletion, often without requiring specialised training [3]. 

A crucial first step in using generative image models, such as diffusion models, is providing effective prompts. According to Jiang et. al [4], some challenges of prompt engineering include finding examples for prompts, troubleshooting and assessing if prompts are improving. To enhance prompt engineering for non-technical users, research has investigated user-friendly approaches for crafting effective prompts for generative image models. For example, Promptify provides prompt recommendations for text to image models using the LLM GPT-3.5 to suggest keywords and facilitating the organisation of generated images [5]. In contrast, PromptMagician utilises the DiffusionDB dataset’s collection of prompts and images to produce keyword recommendations and filters resulting images [2]. 

This project addresses challenges that users, who are unfamiliar with machine learning models, encounter when attempting to articulate their preferences and requirements to generative AI using prompts. 

Related Work
Previous research has investigated the use of generative image models to illustrate fairy tales. For instance, Ruskov discusses using Midjourney v4 to create illustrations for fairytales and devising an prompt refinement process for image creation [6]. Another example is FairyTailor, a platform for blending generated text with images from Unsplash to construct children’s fairytales and offers features such as auto-completion [7]. 

Two papers that explore using LLMs to augment the writing process, [8] and [3], develop applications with writing interfaces that integrate writing suggestions generated by AI. Singh et al. designed an interface that also provides images from Unsplash and audio from Freesound to further enhance the writing process [8]. Conversely, Yuan et al. incorporate a chatbot which writers can use for generating ideas or conducting research [3].  Furthermore, there are also publicly available AI writing tools for use cases such as copywriting and marketing [9]. To that end, a fiction writing tool called Sudowrite uses Transformer models such as GPT-3 by OpenAI and the diffusion model DALL·E to generate images, text autocompletions, writing feedback, and plot ideas [10, 11]. 
 
This project will build upon prior research by implementing the recommendations provided in these papers, including using advanced models such as GPT-4 for prompting, adopting chain of thought prompting for prompt clarification, introducing negative prompts, and the enhancement of user control over multiple hyper-parameters [5, 2].

Project Summary
The objective of this research project is to build an image generation application that will assist writers in brainstorming ideas by providing visual inspiration for worldbuilding and character design. 

Writers often utilize Pinterest to find visual inspiration, curating vision boards that evoke the aesthetics and themes of their story. However, it is difficult to find images that precisely capture their vision, particularly if characters are fantastical creatures with unconventional appearances. Additionally, commissioning custom artwork is expensive and searching for images is time-consuming and tedious. This project addresses this problem by providing a tool for facilitating the process of outlining and drafting fiction by generating relevant images based on writing snippets and narrative context. Writers often struggle to decide which ideas to pursue but visualising plot threads as sequence of images could aid in making narrative decisions.
Essentially, this tool will streamline the brainstorming portion of the writing process by providing reference images for worldbuilding and character description and assisting in refining ideas and developing conflict.
This application will also generate writing prompts from external images (i.e. Pinterest, Unsplash) or pair images with prompts to inspire writers, potentially leveraging an LLM to supply personalised story suggestions.
Implementation 

First, informal user interviews with writers who have some experience with or interest in using generative AI for writing will be conducted. Based on the interviews, user requirements will be generated and the user interface design will be completed in Figma. 

Currently, the system will be designed to offer writing prompts and plot ideas for brainstorming, along with a storyboarding feature that generates images to illustrate story scenes. Users will also have the ability to access previous prompts and images.

This application will be built using Python Flask for the backend and an JavaScript framework (i.e. React) for the frontend. It will leverage an LLM (i.e. GPT-4.0) for prompt refinement and creative writing assistance in conjunction with a diffusion model (i.e. Stable Diffusion or DALL·E 3) for image generation. Before selecting a model, the costs for the API and the advantages of each model will be compared. However, techniques such as Dreambooth will be useful for finetuning Stable Diffusion [12] in particular to ensure the uniform portrayal of characters across multiple images [6]. Prompt engineering for the diffusion model will employ few-shot and zero-shot prompting techniques, drawing examples from the internet and initial model output, as recommended in this paper [4]. The choice of these models and technologies is informed by prior applications with similar approaches.

The prototype evaluation will focus on writers with limited generative AI experience, and involve both remote and in-person testing. Data will be collected within the application (i.e. logging user interactions in a database) to enable remote testing. The study aims to assess system usability, especially for brainstorming, storyboarding, and plot generation.

To further evaluate the prototype, criteria will be established for assessing image quality and distinctiveness. User feedback and comparisons with images generated by other models can contribute to improving the model.  

Timeline

The tasks and corresponding deadlines for this project are depicted in Figure 1 below. The dissertation and research paper, respectively, will be submitted one week in advance of the official deadlines, allowing for flexibility in the schedule.

Although the task breakdown appears comprehensive, the hard deadlines are specified for each milestone (i.e. Literature Review) in GitHub Projects and the soft deadlines for tasks associated with these milestones can be adjusted as necessary.
