# attempt #1 for designing prompts to get two consistent characters (sanjana & akash) in multiple settings 

**My process**

1. Generate the images of the characters individually.
2. Generate scene images in which I reference the portrait images of the characters to make sure their appearance is consistent in these scene images.

**Prompt for Dall E**
> Create an image using the request without modifications. After generating the image, tell me what seed number was used for the image and the styles used for the image, and the generation ID number:
> 
> 
> "Create a high resolution detailed photo-realistic image of Akash, a tall and slim 23-year-old Indian boy, exuding an aura of quiet intellect and introspection. His dark brown wavy hair softly frames his face, enhancing his serious, contemplative expression. Behind his glasses, his brown eyes reflect a depth of thought and a passion for the stories and knowledge he surrounds himself with daily. The glasses are not just an accessory but a window into his scholarly soul, emphasizing his keen insight and reflective nature.
> 
> Dressed in his customary attire, Akash wears a denim long sleeve shirt, embodying a blend of practicality and subtle elegance suitable for his work in a beloved bookshop. His outfit is thoughtfully coordinated with brown pants that accentuate his tall, lean figure, and black leather ankle boots that add a touch of timeless style to his look. On his wrist, he sports a plain watch, its simplicity a testament to his preference for functionality and understated sophistication.
> 
> Akash's demeanor is usually quite serious, a trait that aligns with his deep love for reading and writing. He finds solace and inspiration among the towering shelves of the bookshop where he works, a sanctuary filled with the scent of old paper and the silent whisper of countless stories. This environment, dimly lit with ambient light casting gentle shadows, perfectly complements Akash’s persona, highlighting not only his physical characteristics but also his cultural heritage and the serene intensity of his character."

"Create a high resolution detailed photo-realistic image of Sanjana,  21-year-old Indian girl, characterized by her dark brown wavy hair and deep dark brown eyes, embodying tranquility and introspection. Sanjana should appear lost in thought, her contemplative expression illuminated by a soft glow that highlights her features. She's dressed casually yet stylishly in a vibrant red flannel long sleeve shirt paired with classic denim jeans, embodying a youthful, carefree spirit.  She always carries a tote bag, signifying her preparedness for any adventure or moment of inspiration, accompanied by personal items like a sketchbook and a cup of chai in settings where appropriate. Sanjana's style includes delicate gold rings and intricate bracelets, symbolizing her elegance and cultural heritage."

**Prompt for GPT**
> Combine the two prompts below and adapt them to generate a new image that includes both Sanjana and Akash standing by some graves looking down at the dirt. Include these details about the cemetery: there are twisted gnarled trees, light mist covers the ground, the full moon is visible high above. Sanjana is wearing blue jeans and a tank top with her full body visible. Akash is also dressed in a black shirt with blue jeans. Make sure that Sanjana and Akash's appearance remain consistent:

**Result from GPT**
"Generate a high-resolution, detailed, photo-realistic image capturing a poignant moment with Sanjana and Akash, both in their early twenties, standing side by side by some graves in a mystical cemetery. Sanjana, with her dark brown wavy hair and deep dark brown eyes, embodies a serene introspection. She's dressed in blue jeans and a tank top, revealing her youthful and carefree spirit, her posture reflecting a moment of solemn reflection. Akash, tall and slim, stands next to her, his serious, contemplative gaze hidden behind glasses. His dark brown wavy hair and the soft glow highlighting his thoughtful expression match Sanjana's tranquil demeanor. Akash is dressed in a simple black shirt paired with blue jeans, his attire echoing his quiet intellect and the depth of his contemplation.

Together, they look down at the dirt of the graves before them, their expressions a mix of reverence and quiet sorrow, illuminated by the soft, ethereal light of the full moon visible high above in the night sky. The cemetery around them is alive with the eerie beauty of twisted, gnarled trees, and a light mist covers the ground, adding to the solemn and mystical atmosphere of the setting.

The scene captures both Sanjana and Akash in a moment of shared contemplation, surrounded by the ethereal beauty of the cemetery under the full moon. The details of their appearance—Sanjana's delicate gold rings and intricate bracelets, Akash's plain watch, and their thoughtful expressions—remain consistent, highlighting their individual personalities and their shared connection to the moment and place. This image seeks to encapsulate the deep, introspective bond between them, set against the backdrop of a magical, moonlit cemetery."

### takeaways from generating images with sanjana, akash & roshan

- Generating images with 3 characters (sanjana, akash, and roshan) actually took a few minutes longer than doing it for 1 or 2 characters. The latency may be too much and the prompt-image accuracy was much worse compared to the 2 or 1 character scene images.
- The quality has plummeted.
- It’s also hard to reliably get images where all 3 characters are visible.
  
### takeaways from generating images with sanjana and akash

- It definitely looks like them across the images in different settings - but this is when the original generated images of the characters are referenced and the model is instructed to base the characters’ appearances on those images.
    - There are minor issues like Akash’s eyes aren’t always rendered correctly.
    - The characters also tend to appear posed like models - they stand stiffly and/or look at the viewer even when I specify that they’re doing a certain activity like looking at perfume bottles.
        - Specifying candid shot and emphasising a few more times in the prompt that it should be a candid image seems to help * scroll up for example where it worked *
- Telling the LLM to emphasise certain things if it’s missing from the image can help generate better images ⇒ I could attempt to anticipate this in my application by designing the prompts to the LLM so that they emphasise things that Dall E tends to forget or overlook unless the prompt is worded in a particular way.
