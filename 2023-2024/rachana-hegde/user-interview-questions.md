# User interview questions for gathering user requirements

## Describing my project to potential users

For my master’s research project, I am building an image generation application that will assist writers in brainstorming ideas by providing visual inspiration for worldbuilding and character design. Essentially this means that I will design an interface that enables people who are less familiar with writing prompts for AI models to generate the types of images they want to and use these images as inspiration – for example, if they have writer’s block and don’t know where to begin.

The tool will help the writer produce a mood board or a storyboard.

The main criteria I am looking to fulfil is whether you have an interest in using AI for image generation to enhance your writing process.

I’ll conduct the interview over Zoom and I hope it’s alright if it’s recorded. The recordings won’t be shared and I’ll send you forms on data privacy to fill out and brief you on how your data is used – it’ll be anonymized and summarized/analysed in my dissertation.

## Explaining the purpose of the interview:

The purpose of this interview is to gather user requirements for the application that I am designing for my master’s research project.

Some of my current ideas for the core functionality is prompt refinement (the tool helps you write good prompts for image generation), the ability to have user feedback for the generated images, a feature that displays images clustered based on similarity, folders to save images, and a storyboard and/or moodboard where writers can organize the images.

I’m trying to determine whether some other features would be more useful or if the features I have planned are good/helpful.

## Questions to ask – 25 mins

- What is your writing background? What is your preferred genre and length of story (i.e. novel, short fiction)?
- What is your level of familiarity with using AI tools during your writing process – in particular, text to image generative models?
    - If you have used these tools in the past, what are some challenges you encountered?
- Are there specific types of images or visual styles that you find particularly inspiring for your writing?
- How important is it for you that the generated images match the tone or mood of your story?
- Can you describe a typical writing session? When and how do you incorporate visual inspiration into your writing process?
    - How much time are you willing to spend exploring and generating images as part of your brainstorming process?
- Would you value a feature that allows you to save or export generated images for later use?
- How much control do you want over the generated images? For example, would you prefer detailed settings to fine-tune/customize the appearance of characters or settings?
- In addition to character and setting images, are there other ways you imagine AI could assist in developing your story (i.e. suggesting plot points or dialogue based on the generated images)?
- How important is it for you to give feedback on the generated images? Would you prefer a system that refines its suggestions based on your feedback over time?
    - What type of feedback mechanisms (e.g., rating, good/bad) would you find most helpful?

## Exercise: Integrating Image Generation into Your Writing Process

**Tool:** Stable Diffusion in Dream Studio (https://dreamstudio.ai/generate)

Since I’m building an image generation application, I want to understand what it would like if you were to integrate a tool such as Stable Diffusion or Dall E into your writing process.

So I would like you to do an exercise that simulates the process of designing prompts to generate a character, setting, or otherwise relevant image for your story.

You can use DreamStudio which provides a web interface for Stable Diffusion to generate a few images and then describe any challenges you encounter while completing the exercise.

**Note – encourage participant to think out loud and describe their thought process while doing this exercise.**

**Explaining the tool – the ‘seed’ setting:**

- By generating a random seed the AI is able to generate different images each time, even if all other values stay the same. This allows infinite possibilities and an endless variety of images to be created each time.
- By using the seed command, we can force Midjourney to use a specific starting point for our prompt, so that if we use the same seed with the same prompt, we will get the same results.

### **The exercise – 15 mins**

**Introduction**

- Give brief overview of the selected tool – explain what each feature does

**Idea selection**

- Choose a genre. Use Chat GPT to generate some plot ideas. Select a plot idea.
- Come up with a character or setting based on this plot idea – you can generate this using GPT if you want to.

**I.e.**

Prompt #1: Generate five plot ideas for a fantasy short story

Prompt #2: Generate five settings based on the plot ideas you provided

**Prompt Creation**

- Use this description to write a prompt and generate an image that fits your vision.
- Iterate over the prompt refinement process at least 5 times to try and get closer to the image you want.

Character Prompt:

- Ask participants to think about a character for their story. It could be a protagonist, antagonist, or a supporting character.

- Instruct them to create a textual prompt that describes key characteristics of this character. For example, "A mysterious detective with a unique fashion sense."

Setting Prompt:

- Prompt participants to imagine a setting in their story. It could be a cityscape, a fantastical realm, or a mundane but significant location.

- Ask them to create a prompt that captures the essence of the setting. For example, "A bustling futuristic city with floating gardens."

Tool Interaction:

- Input character and setting prompts into the tool to generate images.
- Generate about 5-10 images

**Questions to ask during exercise:**

- Would you ever copy paste text directly from your story or poem into the prompt field and use that?

**Questions to ask after the exercise:**

- How closely do the generated images align with your initial vision?
- Did any unexpected elements in the images spark new ideas for your character or setting?
- How would you incorporate these generated images into your writing process? I.e. Would you use the images as reference points, scene inspiration, or as a starting point for further creative exploration.
- What are some things you liked about using this tool?
- What are some things you disliked about using this tool?
- (Related?) Did you choose to use the advanced settings – why or why not?
- What were some of the challenges of using a tool like this?
    1. Did you find it easy to translate your ideas into prompts?
    2. Were there limitations in the tool's output?
- How could the tool be improved to better suit your creative needs?
- How do you feel about integrating such a tool into your writing process? Do you see potential benefits?
- Would you prefer to use a website, desktop application, browser extension or some other form of this application (ideally so it won’t disrupt your creative workflow)?
