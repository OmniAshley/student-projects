# Interview with User #1

## Part 1

Q: What is your writing background?

A: My writing background is mostly in poetry and on occasion that would include narrative poetry – that would be more applicable to your application. The narrative poetry that I would write would also involve elements on fantasy sometimes but be mostly realistic narrative. That would be based on/involve places I’ve been and childhood memories. That’s what I’ve done so far. My new work would include more realistic literary fiction and so I think it could also use your application because storyboarding is still relevant to the plot and it's also necessary to use different settings. So far in the stage I’m in with the planning – at the very beginning of the process – the more ideas the better.

Q: What is your level of familiarity with using AI in your writing process?

A: I don’t use AI at all.

Q: Is there a specific type of imagery or visual style that you find particularly inspiring for your writing?

A: I like magical realism in art. One thing that I really like that I also have on my wall is the Persistence of Memory by Salvador Dali. That’s like a landscape that has a bunch of realistic images that are sort of – there are melted clocks for example – that doesn’t exist in the real world but that’s something that has a fantasy element added in to a more realistic background. Those are the kind of images that inspire me – something that’s realistic but has a different – a little spice. Surrealist art.

Q: How important is it for you that the generated images match the tone or mood of your story?

A: I think the tone and mood comes from the image based on the colours used and the actual objects in it. I think those are so closely linked that they are really important when viewing the image. The writing that would be prompted from that would be strongly correlated with the image and tone that comes from it.

Q: Can you describe a typical writing session? When and how do you incorporate visual inspiration into your writing process? I.e. If you find images on Pinterest, for example. Also you can think of this in terms of images you already use or if you find images from a Google search.

A: I usually use my own images – basically photography of what I’ve already seen so that wouldn’t exactly be AI generated. But it would be sort of involved in the image if it’s a more realistic scene. It would be related to my writing process because a lot of my writing process requires the memory of the event and that involved that setting of the photograph – I guess what’s important to me is not only the image itself and not only the tone, it has to be real to me. If I were to use somebody else’s photograph or something that was generated from AI that could be somebody else’s photograph – the writing process that would come from that is associating that with one of my own memories…and sort of creating an link there that also involves the tone that you spoke of. And sort of extrapolating whatever scene or characters or objects that were in the more realistic AI generated photograph. The writing process would just be to describe what I’m seeing in the image and also linking that back to my own memories and my own feelings or opinions related to whatever’s in the image. My own process doesn’t really use AI so it’s hard for me to come up with a more hypothetical situation…Let me think of this in terms of my novel. What I’ve described is my process with my own images.

Q: What you said about your process – is that mostly for narrative poetry?

A: That’s for the narrative poetry. What I’m trying to do for my novel….My novel is going to be based in a kind of corporate America – but it’ll take place in Canada. What would be useful to me would be images of settings in corporate America, like inside these office buildings and sort of the areas where people would do their meetings like if they’re outside at restaurants or if they’re like at networking events – like outside of work. I guess AI images related to those settings would be useful because I don’t find myself in those settings anymore so my memory is not that good. I guess AI would really help me position myself or position these characters in these settings that I’m not unfamiliar with as much anymore. Either I could totally use that setting or use it as a reference and try to figure my own memories of these situations and these settings.

Q: How much control do you want over the generated images? Do you want to be able to customise the minute details of the character’s appearance or is it more high level?

A: For me, I think it would be mid to high level. One thing I don’t want to do is have the actual characters that I’m still putting together in the AI images. I would feel like then someone else is writing the story for me. For other objects and for the setting, I guess everything else would be mid to high level. For example, food at a restaurant or appetizers at a networking event – those, I would like to have in the image. But these are things that I won’t really remember so to have those things in the image would be really helpful because I don’t remember what we used to eat or what these areas used to look like. So that level of control would be really useful. So everything basically except for the characters which I want control of completely.

Q: So you want to adjust more of the setting details?

A: Yes.

Q: Do you have any other things in mind for how AI could potentially assist in your writing process?

A: For where I’m at in my writing process, the most important thing would be to visualise where these characters are sitting, eating, working or living. Setting for me is the priority if I’m ever using AI images. In terms of plot, I haven’t made much progress on that yet so I’m not sure if I would involve AI in the plot yet or use images to trigger ideas for the plot. It might happen if I do have the setting but so far, I know what kind of settings I would want to use AI with and so that’s where I would want more detail. But beyond setting, I’m not really sure if I would use AI for anything else.

Q: Would you feel like you have less creative control over the narrative if the AI is suggesting more textual things like dialogue or specific plot points?

A: I don’t think I would feel like I have less control. I’m not completely sure how well the AI can imitate what kind of conversations I would hear in certain scenarios. So I think that it could be helpful in minute talking points – for example, in a networking event. Which I keep bringing up because I feel like it will be in my novel.

Q: I’m asking if you feel like you would have less control because you said earlier that you don’t want the AI image to show too much of your characters and you want it to be up to you.

A: I think for non-important filler dialogue – like dialogue that is used when you’re getting to the main point that is unique to the book – that kind of dialogue - it would be helpful if it were in the AI image.  Small things with conversation like small talk or introductions – stuff like that which is a bit generic to the scenario and to the setting would be helpful because it would also remind me that I need to put those things in this conversation [in their book]. That’s the kind of dialogue I’m thinking of that would be useful.

Q: How important is it for you to give feedback on the generated images? Would that be something you would want to do – in terms of telling the system this is good/bad or would you not really care about this feature because you’d rather get on with the rest of the [writing] process?

A: I usually don’t give feedback for anything.

Q: Ok so maybe if the feedback feature was less intrusive/optional.

A: Yes.

## Part 2 – Exercise: Integrating Image Generation into Your Writing Process

**Description of my observation of the user (they were asked to think out loud to help me understand their thought process for writing the prompt and the type of images they wanted to generate).**

Note – Participant was given minimal instruction for using Dream Studio – just a brief description/explanation of the different parameters that can be adjusted but no tutorial or guidance for writing prompts.

Participant: Let’s try to do something that I’m working on…I don’t know if this is going to work [referring to the prompt they entered]. I’ve never used one of these before so I don’t even know if I’m doing it right. I’ve never even used Chat GPT.

![user-interview-1-screenshot1](https://github.com/Vis4Sense/student-projects/assets/66835338/74ec9016-9667-49b8-bc1e-baf150b1f169)

Participant: Why are there men? [Waves cursor over the men in the background of the photo.]. Basically, I want it to look like what I had as a student. What I’m looking for is not just one person as the forefront – I want more of like a scene with multiple people. [Scrolls through the style options.] Just have no style for now and see what that does.

![user-interview-1-screenshot2](https://github.com/Vis4Sense/student-projects/assets/66835338/5e33469f-f4db-438a-850f-83d73a7a2477)

Participant: I do want it to look more realistic. I take back not wanting side characters to be AI because if I don’t use AI for side characters – I feel like I’m going to use people I know. That might be better for me to eliminate personal bias and have people not chase me down after the book comes out.

Q: You’re concerned about putting people you know into your story?

Participant: Yes because if I’m thinking about somebody’s appearance and I put that in the book…

![user-interview-1-screenshot3](https://github.com/Vis4Sense/student-projects/assets/66835338/5a297b88-dd68-49f9-9fe5-4c1c0961cd3e)

Participant: This is actually more like what I was looking for… stuff like this where people are standing around in circles with like drinks and nametags. [Adds nametags to prompt.]

![user-interview-1-screenshot4](https://github.com/Vis4Sense/student-projects/assets/66835338/36e031c2-a150-43fc-8b91-a407b0d0a75b)

Q: Would you ever copy paste text directly from your story or poem into the prompt field and use that?

A: No. I don’t want AI to be using my work which I have copyright over.

Q: I thought it would be an easier starting point since you already have the text.

A: Maybe [I would use] keywords but I think I have the keywords without using text directly from the story… I think what I’m looking at is actually useful and this is kind of what I was looking for [looks at the third batch of generated images].

## Part 3 - Post-Exercise Q&A

Q: How closely do the generated images align with your initial vision?

A: What I wanted to do is try to get as close as I could to my own experiences of these settings and scenarios so the images are somewhat close but maybe those experiences were unique enough to not be able to be generated through image…or maybe I’m also missing the correct words for the experience. Maybe there are specific words that are not coming to mind. But these [images] are pretty close in terms of what I’m looking for. Also having the characters in here that could also be used as side characters is also useful. So using this showed me that it could be used for a little more than I expected.

Q: Were there any unexpected elements that spark new ideas?

A: Yeah, the new ideas are the side characters or having unexpected foods…or unexpected objects that could also be used in the story.

Q: What are some things you liked about using this tool?

A: I like how there’s a negative prompt. I like how there’s different styles for the AI photographs - the realistic setting is the most useful I think because my story is going to be realistic fiction. I haven’t really used the advanced settings but I’m not sure if I would because I think these images are enough for what I’m trying to do.

Q: I was wondering why you decided to skip the advanced settings?

A: I don’t think it’s necessary for me to go into depth.

Q: What are some things you disliked about using this tool?

A: Some of the prompts – for example name tags – is more emphasized than the other prompts. For example, 3 out of 4 of these images have essentially only one of the prompts in it and you can only see the rest of the prompts (networking event, diversity) in the second one [referring to the second photo]. So I would want these phrases and words to come together in a cohesive realistic image and not just focus on one [keyword].

Q: I think that happened because of the weighting in the prompt.

A: I’m not really sure why one would be weighted more than the other but I guess some are weighted more than the others.

Q: What were some of the challenges of using it - did you find it easy to translate your ideas into prompts? Were there limitations in the tool's output?

A: I think that because…I really knew what I was looking for in the image that I got pretty close to it. It’s not exactly what I want because as I said before, I might be missing the correct words or like I’m not a fan of the weight on one of the words as opposed to the others (for the nametags). It essentially did what I did want it to do but I guess the limitations would be coming from my own vocabulary to get to the exact kind of setting that I want. So what you could do – we put in our own prompts here but I’m not sure if you said that earlier that the AI itself will be generating prompt related words to add – but that would also be useful if I’m missing a word that would help me get closer to what I’m looking for that is just not coming to me. Like if there was a prompt that said ‘board room’ or something that would help me get closer to what I want. It’s not what I want exactly in this scenario but I think a prompt like that would also help.

Q: Yeah, I was thinking of integrating it [the application] with chat GPT and asking it to suggest keywords or rephrasing what you’ve written as the prompt.

A: Yeah, that’s a good idea.

Q: So you already addressed the question about how the tool could be improved to better suit your creative needs – you would want prompt suggestions.

A: Yes.

Q: How do you feel overall about integrating such a tool into your writing process?

A: I might use it. It depends on how easily I can get what I’m looking for from google images versus AI because if I can find an image that’s natural and what I’m looking for from google images, I’ll be less likely to use AI. Because to me, there just feels like it would be more work to put in the prompts to get exactly what want from AI versus if I can find the same thing on google images without even trying - that would be more useful for my writing process. It really depends on the specific setting for that.

I think for mine, because it’s realistic fiction, that’s why google images might be more useful but if you’re talking about fantasy – the stuff on google images is still going to be other people’s work whereas AI will be a combination of other people’s work – and so having that kind of combination would be more useful to fantasy writers to like use as a jumping off point for their own work. But I’m not a fantasy writer so I can’t completely validate that.

Q: What type of application would be better for you - would you prefer to use a website, desktop application, browser extension or some other form of this application - so it doesn’t disrupt your flow when you’re writing?

A: I think a website like this [refers to DreamStudio] might work because AI can access it from wherever and I can log in. I’m not sure if you can save these images in different folders and stuff but that would be useful. So if you make an account, you’ll be able to manage these [images] from wherever you are and if you’re able to organize these images from wherever you are – I think those would be two of my priorities. So if it was on a desktop…my laptop’s super old and it’s slow so I don’t even really use it anymore. I just use my work laptop so that’s why I’m more biased towards a website for an application.

Q: I know the memory and storage is an issue for downloading an application from the internet.

A: Yeah definitely.

Q: Does that mean you would want a feature that allows you to save or export generated images – locally?

A: I tend to do all my writing on Google docs. Only when I need to send it out somewhere do I download it. And I used to use more desktop applications when I had the school account but I still find that using Cloud applications like google docs is still more useful for me to organise and access my work. It would be pretty unlikely that I would export these photos because I just tend to keep everything online.

Q: That’s an interesting perspective. For my writing, I saved the images that I find very inspiring and the rest, I put on Pinterest boards.

A: Ohh I never had a Pinterest. I’m more inspired by words than images and so, that’s why I was never a big image girlie.

Q: Would it be helpful if you could see captions for the images generated by the AI itself?

A: Yeah that would be useful. If you also want to use Pinterest as a reference for creating a moodboard for your story, I think it would also useful to have all these – for example, if I just did networking event and took an image from networking event versus one for like another setting – I think it would be nice to make a moodboard for all these images related to one project in your application. That’s just a suggestion but I think it would also be nice to see it with the caption.

Q: I was only thinking of doing the storyboard so that’s helpful. You said you’re not really on the plotting stage so for someone working in a similar way to you, the moodboard would be a better starting point.

A: Yeah, I think so.

Q: What would be the best way to describe you?

A: A poet of 10 years, trying to write a novel.
