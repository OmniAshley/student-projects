# Interview with User #2

Q: What is your writing background? I.e. When you started or the kind of genre you write in or the length of the type of story you like to write.

A: So I mean, I don't write much as of now. I haven't since I got back to Cranfield, but I did start writing when I was back in around school - which I would say around the 6th grade to 7th grade because that was when in school we had to do a bit of creative writing and that really piqued my interest. And then my parents - my mother - back home, really encouraged me. So I got into writing like poems because we had to write poems for English as well.

And in terms of the genre I like to write in for poems, it’s stuff like - I remember writing a poem – it’s kind of like surreal. It's alphabets marching up the hill type thing. So it's kind of like that surreal category, but it can vary to even simple things like - I think there was a poem I wrote about a dream that I had. So it's kind of like interpretation type, right?

And when it comes to writing stories - I got into writing that in high school, like before just coming to Lancaster for my undergrad. And that was really a short genre type thing. That again began in school because we had to do a bit of creative writing, so genre wise I like writing in horror genre and especially if not horror, something to do with like, you know, detective or like crime thriller but not like you know - it's not like Sherlock Holmes type as well. It’s crime mystery thriller.

Q: Would you say you want to pursue writing professionally or more as a hobby/something you enjoy doing in your free time?

A:  So I would like to pursue it as a hobby and as a career I'm - as you may be aware - I'm doing a business management course. If I do have the opportunity, I would love to explore it as a career as well because I think that's something – but I think writing a novel, maybe writing an anthology maybe of poems or a collection of poems. But most likely my view right now is that I would like to pursue it as a hobby.

Q: What would you say your level of familiarity is with using artificial intelligence like chat GPT or image generation in your writing process?

A: So I think it's been pretty useful. I do use chat GPT for like prompts, especially like you mentioned writers block and…I mean that happens to me all the time and I have to like think and think and think…but then chat GPT came along and then the prompts were really…so like I'll give you an example like... I remember typing into chat GPT like, can you give me a short story idea for a horror story set in rural South India for example? I remember writing that and it gave me like a bunch [of prompts] and I was like okay wow this is cool, can you give me some more?

And in terms of like image generation, I really have been using that for my content basically, but it's more of like…I did use it for like let's say make a surreal picture of the Taj Mahal – paint a surreal painting of the Taj Mahal. So it's like the Salvador Dali type, right? So the Taj Mahal is kind of like leaking and stuff. But I haven't used it for story writing.

Q: Okay, so you have used image generation like Dall E - what type of model did you use?

A: So I don't remember exactly what app it was or what website. I don't remember the name, but I did type like medieval India or like ancient India and it had those selections right? You could use surreal and then you could use like studio Gibli type imaging and all that…but it wasn't used for a story writing perspective. I've been using chat GPT for that more specifically.

Q: Oh okay, so the artwork was just something you did for fun then.

A: It was just something that I just wanted to, you know, try out.

Q: What kind of imagery or visual style would you say is inspiring for your writing? Is that the surrealist type of art you were just describing?

A: That's a good question because…if I link it to horror, I would say that yes - the surreal would be kind of like open to interpretation. Because like I said, I don't have experience using like you know, image generation or like AI art generation in this process but I think it can help in the sense, like let's say I use that AI image generation website or like any tool or like for example like the website or tool that you're making and I type in generate an image of a haunted mansion in India, for example, and…so that maybe that can help in that way.

So I would say surreal for horror, but if I'm writing non horror based…I would say something a bit you know normal. Maybe if I'm trying to write some poem, then maybe it might be something like a landscape painting. Like I type a beach or like I type, a farm or something descriptive.

Q: When you were using AI in the past, were there any challenges you encountered - like obstacles that you weren't really sure how to deal with?

A: So the AI usage I have is being limited like I said to chat GPT and to image generation.  Obviously there's AI in like you know, when it comes to like Google search and all that. But like when it comes to chat GPT, I’d say it’s mostly like the prompts - what prompts you give it – that’s really important. I've realized that you might give an idea to chat GPT and it should not give out the prompt that you want because you haven't expressed yourself very clearly to the system. So I think prompt generation and engineering that prompt is something that I was facing a little bit of difficulty with especially when it came to image generation. Because then you have to specify like – if I’m saying haunted mansion then I have to say don’t give extra roofs or don’t have too many windows because the AI system can like you know, sort of duplicate windows and roofs and chimneys, for example. So I would say prompts are big for me personally, and I think I've gotten used to it - I've gotten over it - like for chat GPT, I’ve become more specific. If I use an image generation tool for making a painting of a Haunted Mansion, I'm more specific - no extra roofs, no extra windows. And it's written there as well: be more specific.

Q: Okay, so you're using your experience to get better at refining that?

A: Yeah.

Q: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I think that's the stumbling block for a lot of people in the start, myself included.

A: Yeah.

Q: How important would you say is that the images you generate match the tone or mood of your story? If you're using generated images, or if you were using say Google Image search and you were finding images, would you want those pictures to match the tone and mood of your story?

A: Yeah, I would personally. Let's say again - I'm coming back to a Horror Story example. Let's say if it's like an old abandoned mansion, I wouldn't want it to be a really colorful setting with a beautiful farm in the background. That's not a horror setting, you know?

If I’m writing something - let's say I'm writing a poem about a balloon – I wouldn’t want a car showing up in that picture. So the image – I would like it to be more specific and tailored to the prompt that I'm looking for because it’s just relevant and it’s right in front of you to take inspiration from. But basically [it’s there to] look at and get into the narrative, mood and that setting.

Q: So then when you're using these images in your writing process - what would you say that looks like typically. How would you go about writing essentially?

A: When I go about writing the prompts or writing in general?

Q: Writing in general, like when you're working on this story or poem…What would that look like?

A: So writing in general for me begins with thinking about what I want to write, and that's the major stumbling block for me because, like I said, writers block is real for me. I  sit there with the laptop in front of me and I want to write. I just can’t think of the words. I know I want to write something and I just have to get the words on paper but I just can't find them.

So I would start off with – I wouldn't say a brain map – but it’s kind of like notes… so a horror story set in south India - set in an small village in the hills of South India...involves this character, this history….if I have that small half a page note then I build the characters. I’m more of the sort of person who has that small plan, I start writing and then I build on that as I write. So like this happened, the heroine did this, the villain did this. I’m kind of like the person who just goes with the writing.

Q: Which stage would you say looking at imagery comes in?

A: I would say that comes in the beginning but also during the process. So how it works is –

like I said, I haven't used image generation but if I were to use it as an inspiration - I would obviously put it in the beginning. This is what I want the setting to look like – so it gives me an idea, right? So I want to describe the house this way - this mansion was old, dusty, abandoned, intimidating to look at, terrifying to be in, for example. And then, I write more about that house and then I can add descriptive features – the floor shook, the floor creaked under your feet because of the age, wind was seeping in because the window was broken. I use it mostly as I write as well but also to get an understanding of what I want to write.

Q: Would you value a feature in an application like this which allowed you to save or export images?

A: Absolutely because in my experience, it’s mostly been premium usage so I have to pay money if I have to log in. Saving the image would be great – and exporting it would be great as well. Let’s say you have an app where you can store all these images and you can create a folder and just revisit them any time you want to. And you can be like on Monday I made this prompt and I got this image, and on Tuesday I got this prompt and this image. So I think personally that would be great because at this moment there are not that many apps or websites where you can generate images like this and save them.

Q: So like you can sort of see the prompting history like this prompt this image.

A:  Yeah, and that would be like so you could build upon the prompts. I made this image with this prompt. [It lets you figure out…] What can I do to get a better image?

Q: How much control would you like over the images you generate? Like would you want to customize the characters appearance, for example, or are you looking for more of a high level overview of the setting.

A: I would like some degree of control over the specifications and the character. But at the end of the day, I like the randomness of the AI system because it just brings you something that's like oh wow. So let’s say I type a prompt in – Indian Sherlock Holmes character and it comes up with really interesting character looking character. And if it’s a really good randomly generated image, I would love to build on that. So this is Mr. A, he’s from india, he’s from city A. This is Ms. B, she comes from City B – something [like that] for example.

I like the randomness, the spontaneity. I like that you can get a random character from the AI and build upon it. But I think adding some specifications – so maybe you could say I want a character who’s from Mexico, for example – and some control would be good.

A: So maybe more flexibility where sometimes you can have more randomness and sometimes it's more tailored to the thing you had in your head?

A: Yeah, so maybe a bar where you can select some more randomness, or less randomness or more randomness and the AI will react [in a] relevant [way].

Q: How else would you say AI could assist you with your writing process, if there's anything you have in mind.

A: If it can write the story for me, that would be great! But no, to be honest, giving me an idea, setting me off, like giving me a prompt – because I have used chat GPT [and said] can you give me like a rough introduction of 500 words and then I can build up on that.  And then image generation obviously is something that could prompt me in that direction. But I personally would only use it for giving me a prompt or setting me off – just pushing me onwards on my journey.

Q: Would you find it useful if there's dialogue or certain descriptions provided based on the images?

A: So let’s say a caption underneath the image?

Q: Yes, or more detail perhaps – like you were saying about the mansion description but it’s provided by chat GPT instead of coming from you.

A: Yeah that would be a concept that is pretty interesting. I’ve never thought about it much. When the image gets generated, sometimes it’s open to interpretation but the only description you have is the prompt  that you put in the first place. But if you have a prompt that appears when the image is generated – yeah that could be helpful. But me personally, it’s not a necessity. But that would be really interesting.

Q: How important would it be for you to give feedback on the images? Would you prefer the system to sort of change how it interacts with you based on your feedback? Or are you just not interested in providing feedback?

A: No, I'm interested in providing feedback because it's something that helps the system get better. I'm not really aware of AI or machine learning as much as you, but I think giving feedback to an AI system would help the AI system become better over time. And become more precise when it reacts to prompts. I personally would like to give feedback because then next time I come back to use it, maybe it will provide me with a much more specific image that I want or maybe it can provide me with fewer errors, for example.

Q: Is there any feedback mechanism that you can think of which would be more helpful for you? Like a rating system?

A: Like the feedback mechanism, I'm really not aware, but I would say it could be something of a mix between a rating system and maybe you could describe…let's say if someone gives below 5 stars, maybe the system could ask – why did he gives us a 5 out of 10, give your reasons. Or maybe you could have a box underneath – do you have anything specific to add for feedback? So I think a mix of that - a rating system out of 10 and specific boxes where users can fill in their feedback.

## Part 2 – Exercise: Integrating Image Generation into Your Writing Process

Description of my observation of the user - they were asked to think out loud to help me understand their thought process for writing the prompt and the type of images they wanted to generate. Note – Participant was given minimal instruction for using Dream Studio – just a brief description/explanation of the different parameters that can be adjusted but no tutorial or guidance for writing prompts.

**Participant was offered two options – to generate an image for a current project or a story idea that they already have. Or to use chat GPT to come up with plot ideas and characters/settings based on those plots. This user chose the first option.**

Participant: Okay, I’m going to try a prompt of my own….I’m referring to the interview. So my thought process is basically based on what we were discussing in the interview. So I’m like ‘haunted mansion in the hills of South India surrounded by tea estates and with a stormy background’. If I choose a style, let’s see…Let’s say I go with cinematic. There’s nothing I want to avoid right now [referring to the negative prompt field]. I just want to see how it goes.

[Checks the advanced settings.] So generation steps is how many times the image is sampled…I think this is like how many times the AI system will run through it and the more times it runs over it, the more accurate the picture will be. I think that would tax the system too much, so I think I’ll keep it at 40 for now, just to see what I get. My Internet might be a bit slow too.

Q: Do you think speed is a priority when you're using a tool like this, or are you OK with waiting for a bit of time?

Participant: I don't mind waiting, but if it's too long, then obviously that's, you know…And I've been on image generation websites where it takes way too [long].

Participant: Okay, perfect. So this is something I had in mind. [Clicks on the second image in the first batch.] It kind of looks like it’s hovering but it looks pretty cool to me. [Clicks on the third image in the first batch.] Yeah, it looks pretty cool. [Clicks on the fourth image.] And then you’ve got this crow that adds to the eeriness.

Q: So do would you say that you would need to try again to generate an image closer to your vision? Or is this suitable?

Participant: This is suitable. Obviously I can go around the mansion and maybe I can say it doesn't have this intricate of a roof or it doesn't have this many pillars. But it gives me a feel of the location…it’s misty, it looks damp and there’s obviously no one here – it looks like it’s in the middle of nowhere. It can give me a good feel of the environment. Just look at this house - there's so many pillars here that gives me the impression that if you go inside you’re never coming out and you're surrounded by mist and fog. The surrounding looks really serene but you’ve got this mansion smack bang in the middle. So it's pretty cool and I love this image particularly [referring to the fourth image] because you're almost there…You get the impression you can see this mysterious shadow in one of these windows staring at you or this ghostly figure walking down that corridor.

Q: Would you be OK with doing a second exercise to generate an image for a character in one of your stories?

Participant: Let’s do this…I’m just going to go with an Indian Sherlock Holmes…So I don’t research beforehand – I do use chat GPT – but in this case, I haven’t done any research, I’m just going on the interview. So Indian Sherlock Holmes…with a grey beard, an iron cane, dressed in an elegant two piece suit with a waistcoat, with a Great Dane on a leash…I don’t want to tax it too much, let’s see.  [Selects cinematic style.]

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6f72ca84-670c-4a4a-ba35-48571350322d/3f79de0f-f1f0-4b77-b742-3f847afadadc/Untitled.png)

Participant: [Clicks on first image] I think this is really cool. I’m really impressed. [Clicks on fourth image.] I think this character doesn’t have a leg – [he’s] missing a leg. Oh one of the dogs has got its leg – what is happening? [Clicks on second image and zooms in.] I could use negative prompts – ‘no artificial lens’ – the eyes look a bit wonky. This eye looks a bit cloudy so it could add an element of mystery so I could use that in writing. That staff does not look iron…[Clicks on first image.] I think this is probably the favourite one. This is something that’s completely spontaneous.

## Part 3 – Post-Exercise Q&A

Q: Do you think you would need to do more batches of image generation or would this be sufficient?

Participant: In this instance…I would want my character to…dress more in a modern fashion. I mentioned Sherlock Holmes obviously and a two piece suit and a waistcoat, it obviously looked back to Sherlock Holmes for reference but maybe if I enter in ‘a modern outfit with a modern suit’ then perhaps I would run it again. But I think as of now it looks really cool. The first two look really cool.

Q: Would you ever copy paste text directly from your story or your poem into the prompt field and use that as the starting point?

A: I haven’t done that before but it’s something that looks pretty interesting. If I do get the opportunity – if I do have a really specific character in mind then I might do that, but I haven't tried it so I have no experience in that. I have no idea, yeah.

Q: So you would say the images that you generated align fairly closely with your initial vision, right?

A: The mansion aspect, yeah it did. Obviously I wasn’t expecting the AI system to generate a really specific mansion with really realistic features. For Sherlock Holmes, it was pretty interesting because when I typed in two piece suit – obviously Sherlock Holmes kind of transported the AI to Victorian times but it wasn’t something that I wasn’t looking for. It was just something that was random, by chance. If I had specified ‘dressed in modern work attire’ it might have generated something more relevant but this is fine.

Q: How would you incorporate these images into your writing process? So would it be a the reference point or scene inspiration essentially?

A: For the haunted mansion, it would be scene inspiration and also a reference point because the mansion won’t look specific – it’s got this veranda – it gives you a rough idea. The tea estates surrounded by mist and fog – that was pretty cool.

Q:  What were some things you liked about using a dream studio?

A: The randomness really. I like the randomness of the AI system. Obviously when you’re expecting randomness then you obviously have to expect that the AI system will make mistakes when it comes to – like we saw with Sherlock Holmes, there was one mistake in the limbs. But then I think apart from that - I think I really like the randomness.

And also the ability to just make your own prompt and randomize the prompt if you're looking to just…make a character today and randomize the prompt – even that can give you an idea for something.

Q: Was there anything you disliked about using it?

A: So as of now - because this will be my first time using it - I wouldn't say I have any dislike. But the idea that a negative prompt - like I have to specify [it]…like how much do I specify right? I have to specify how many pillows, windows, doors – but that’s not really something that’s annoying. I don't think that's annoying at all. It’s just that it’s more effort.

Q: Would you say you found it easy to translate your ideas into prompts, or was that more difficult than you expected?

A: It was just like a spontaneous prompt. It was pretty easy. I was actually surprised how quickly I was able to come up with the prompt, but then that's because we were talking about it during the course of this interview, right? So I had some rough idea in the back of my mind for [the] prompt, but then it's not something that I found really difficult personally.

Q: Was there a reason why you chose not to use the advanced settings like too much added effort/time or you just didn't feel it was necessary?

A: At this moment, I didn't feel it was necessary, but I think when it when it came to the [generation] steps, I think if you ran the AI system more, maybe it could produce some more accurate image. I mean, I don't know how it works exactly. So as of now it wasn't really necessary for me to have like a go at the advanced settings.

Q: Would you think a tutorial or something like that would be helpful for you to understand how the AI works better or is that not something you're interested in when using a tool?

A: Obviously other users will have to believe that the tutorial is necessary. I would say yeah we can have a tutorial. But maybe instead it can be prompts that show up every time you hover over a button or before you start using the app or website - it can be like a series of prompts that show up and it lets you use [the application and] get on with making the prompt and everything. So then keeping those tiny bits of information when you hover over each button or each aspect [of the tool], that's interesting.

Q: Is there any other way you think that this tool, Dream Studio, could be improved to better suit your creative needs?

A: I haven’t used image generation like I said so often for this but it pretty much gives me the independence to choose the type – isometric, 3d, photographic, anime – so I think that’s really cool. As of now I really don't have any recommendations to make because I used it for the first time…I think as of now, it's absolutely fine for me, yeah.

Q: So you would you say that you see benefits in integrating something like this into your writing process?

A: Yeah, personally I do. It puts my ideas and prompts into an image which I can just refer to rather than visualising it in my mind. It’s like a visual aid – and for a character as well. So it gives me like – okay this is a really interesting character that I can build upon. So he wasn’t wearing a two piece suit – he was wearing maybe a winter jacket with some gloves and hats and it’s snowing…It puts my ideas in[to] an image.

Q: So ideally would it be better if this was a website or like a desktop application or a browser extension? Just so it wouldn't disrupt your creative flow when you're writing and then you're using this.

A: Almost all of the image generation tools that I've used have been websites. It hasn’t hampered me personally. I wouldn't mind using websites, but maybe having a desktop application would be pretty cool because then you could just open it immediately and open it any time, and it’s already open. I don't know - some users might prefer desktop application.

I personally don't have a preference, but I would say if I had to choose, I would go with a website because if I need to log in, I can log in. This is for me at the beginning of the stage [of writing], so it’s kind of incorporated into the design. I can have the website open and I can have my notes open as well so I can just write.
