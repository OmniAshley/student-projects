# LLMs Benchmark (Classification and Aspect Based SA)
**Objective**
To compare the performance of several LLMs in providing sentiment analysis of short financial articles.

## Classification SA
**Test dataset**: [Financial Phrasebank](https://huggingface.co/datasets/financial_phrasebank) 
English sentences from financial news, and classified as either positive, negative, or neutral by researchers knowledgeable in the finance domain.

This benchmark **using 1,000 sample records** (random seed = 42) from **"sentence_allagree"** subset. 
The distribution of the test set is same as the subset population (Neutral: 61.4%, Positive: 25,2%, Negative: 13,4%)

Test method: Zero-shot

the average number of word of the test dataset is 22 words/tokens
Prompt used are inspired from Wenxuan Zhang et al. Titled Sentiment Analysis in the Era of Large Language Models: A Reality Check:

The prompt:
"Please perform news sentiment classification task: \n\nNEWS: {news}'\n\n Assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.\nLABEL:"

dataset example:
| Sentence | Label |
| ------------ | ---- |
|The mall is part of the Baltic Pearl development project in the city of St Petersburg , where Baltic Pearl CJSC , a subsidiary of Shanghai Foreign Joint Investment Company , is developing homes for 35,000 people .|1 neutral|
|In the reporting period , net sales rose by 8 % year-on-year to EUR64 .3 m , due to the business acquisitions realized during the first half of 2008-09 , the effect of which was EUR10 .9 m in the review period .|2 positive|
|Pharmaceuticals group Orion Corp reported a fall in its third-quarter earnings that were hit by larger expenditures on R&D and marketing .|0 negative|

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.24634

SEntFiN 1.0, a human-annotated dataset of 10,753 news headlines with entity-sentiment annotations, of which 2,847 headlines contain multiple entities, often with conflicting sentiments.

dataset example:
| Sentence | Label |
| ------------ | ---- |
|Gold shines on seasonal demand; Silver dull|{"Gold": "positive", "Silver": "negative"}|
|US stocks finish mixed amid more tech selling|{"tech": "negative", "US stocks": "neutral"}|
|Oil prices mixed ahead of US supply report|{"Oil": "neutral"}|

This test **using 150 sample records** (random seed = 42). 

Test method: **Few-shot learning** (5 shot) with current prompt:

f'''Please perform news sentiment classification task: \n\nNEWS: {news}'\n\n tag all (aspect, sentiment) pairs. 
    Aspect should be substring of the sentence, and sentiment should be selected from: ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. 
    \n\nIf there are no aspect-sentiment pairs, return an empty list. Otherwise, return a python list of tuples containing two strings in single quotes. 
    Please return python list only, without any other comments or text. 
    \nExample One: \nNews: Would stick to banking: Girish Pai, Centrum Broking. \nLabel:[("banking", "positive"), (Centrum Broking", "neutral")].
    \nExample Two: \nNews: Gold shines on seasonal demand; Silver dull. \nLabel:[("Gold", "positive"), ("Silver", "negative")]
    \nExample Three: \nNews: Strong deals crucial for Wipro's growth push. \nLabel:[("Wipro", "neutral")]
