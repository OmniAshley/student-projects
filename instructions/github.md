# GitHub.com
We will use this shared github reporsitory for project file and code, so you 
1. will never lose your code (because of corrupted USB or hard drive), and
2. can easily show it to other people (e.g.,as part of your work portfolio for job application).

If you never use git before: 
- concepts and commandline tool (git): https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 (first 2 chapters)
- github (a website) tutorial: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world

You probably want to check out [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) that provides features that you will need to pay otherwise.

How to use different GitHub features for the project:
  - The repository is public, so don't upload any data that you don't want to share
    - You can create a separate private repository for sensitve data. Follow the 'data management plan' of your ethics application.   
  - Please use [this (wiki) page](https://github.com/kaidatavis/student-projects/wiki/Meeting-Notes) as the template for meeting notes
    - Follow the meeting notes/minutes template there and the latest one on top.
    - [This guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) can get you started if you never used markdown before 
      - It is similar to HTML, but much simpler. Also very useful for programing.
    - Save the meeting note as a 'readme.md' (such as [this file](https://github.com/kaidatavis/student-projects/blob/master/2023-summer/readme.md)) under the appropriate folder (such as [2023-summer](https://github.com/kaidatavis/student-projects/tree/master/2023-summer))
  - 'Issues': todo list/tasks and coding issue
    - Each 'issue' is a task to complete (action from the meeting)
    - Assign an issue to the person that is responsible 
  - 'Projects': planning and project management (this has been updated recently, so points below may be updated) 
    - You can create a kanban board in 'project' (similar to Trello), 
    - create "milestones', e.g., one for each iteration
    - add 'issues' to 'milestones', and set deadline
    - start with [this project template](https://github.com/users/kaidatavis/projects/2)
      - add your name to the project title, such as 'Kai's project plan'
      - add your name to all the project issues, such as 'Kai - recruit users'
  - Please make a subfolder under the appropriate folder, such as `[2023-summer](https://github.com/kaidatavis/student-projects/tree/master/2023-summer)', for your project:
    - Please send me your github account username or email, so I can add you to the repository.
    - Please name your folder like this: year-degree-name-title (e.g., 2023-msc-kaixu-visual-analytics-for-sensemaking)
    - Use the your folder for your code and other things like notes (in markdown)
    - Include in your folder a 'readme.md' file to list all the things in your folder (e.g., which subfolder contains what) and other information such as how to run your code.
    - Don't include large files as everyone else will need to download them as well (when they do a 'pull' of the repository).
    - There will be top-level folder(s) for share resouces such as datasets.
