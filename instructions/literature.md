# Litearature Review

## Existing Work
- Needs to be much more **complete** than the litearture review in the project proposal;
- Cover different types of resources: app, website, service, organisation, physical print/product ...
- Focus on the most relevant: help you to narrow down your scope.
  - For example, if your project is about AI-based recommendations, there is no need to introduce what AI is (the reader would know) and go straight to the latest machine learing models for recommendation.
- Include academic publications to support your argument: 
  - You can include webpages and online articles, but these are not 'peer reviewed', i.e., anyone can potentially say saything online, and as a result these are usually not regarded as reliable evidence.
- Places to search for academic papers:
  - [IEEE Xplore](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp) (recommended)
  - [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/) (recommended)
  - [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)
- Things to consider when selecting which papers to cite
  - IEEE Xplore and ACM Digital Library are usually more rigourous than Google Scholar: all papers published there are checked by one or more researchers, whereas this is not always the case for Google Scholar (such as self-publishing on arXiv).
  - Papers that are more than 5 years old is often outdated (no longer the state of the art), especially in an active research field such as machine learning. Make sure there is no later work that supersedes it if you want to use it.
  - Papers in well known journals and conferences, such as Nature or Science, are considered strong argument/evidence. 
  - You can also get an idea of how good a journal or conference is from its 'impact factor' (has different names) such as the 'h5' metrics used by [Google](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng) or the 'impact score' by [research.com](https://research.com/conference-rankings/computer-science).

For this project, you are likely to find good-quality related work from these journals and conference
 - IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics ([IEEE TVCG](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=2945))
 - ACM conference on human factors in computing systems ([ACM CHI](https://dl.acm.org/conference/chi))
 - [Computer Graphics Forum](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14678659) (if you want to cast a wider net)

Besides search, it can be very useful to just go through the latest papers from these journals and conferences
- Because relevant papers do not necessarily include the same keywords (a paper about analysing user behaviours may not have the term 'sensemaking')
- Start from the latest issue/year, and then move onto the year before once completed, and so on.
  - usually the last 3-5 years will be sufficient.
- Have a quick look of the title and/or abstract to check if the paper is relevant or not
  - many papers can be excluded by the title alone
  - save the paper in zotero if it seems relevant after reading the abstract
- We will use a shared zotero group to collect and share all the relevant papers found (more below in the 'reference' section)


## Development Technologies

- Be **open** about what form the project prototype will be: app, website, service, organisation, physical print/product ...
- Research different ways of implementation:
  - For example for app development, there is native and hybrid, and then there are many different hybrid frameworks. 
  - Comparison: 
    - Identify required **functions**, such as user regiter/login, database, messaging, image/video, ...
    - Compare different options regarding to the functions: is it possible at all, how easy it is to learn/program, how fast/secure/reliable it is, ...
- Justify your choice

## Reference
- Two parts: citation in the main text and the references at the end of reprot.
- Use a tool; don't create reference manually.
  - Recommended: zotero (see details below)
  - Use zotero for collecting and inserting citations/references
  - We will also use zotero to share relevant papers. 
    - Add all the relevant papers to this Zotero Group Library: [Sensemaking and human-AI Teaming](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4762437/sensemaking_and_human-ai_teaming)
    - Use Zotero tags to group the papers (don't just use all the tags Zotero automatically created)
    - Don't upload the full paper PDF file (the free zotero group library has a very limited storage size)
    - Do include a link to the public/free online full paper pdf if there is one using the 'notes' section in Zotero.
    - Use the 'notes' section to summarise what the paper is about and discuss its stregnth and weakneess.
- If you are using Latex, 
  - follow this [overleaf bibliography tutorial](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Using_bibliographies_on_Overleaf);
  - watch my [latex tutorial](https://youtu.be/PqW8myobrPE), which includes references.
  - you can use Zotero (see below) to collect the papers from publication webiste (such as IEEE xplore and ACM Digital Library) and then generates the bibtex entry.
  - IEEE xplore and ACM Digital Library also provide the bibtex entry on the webpage for each paper: 'cite this' for Xplore, 'export citation' (double quote button) for ACM Digital library.
- If you are not using Latex, use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). 
  - This is a recording of me showing how to use Zotero: https://youtu.be/R_5bjdE-kSw
  - use their browser extension to automatically add reference: 
    - [Zotero connector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zotero-connector/ekhagklcjbdpajgpjgmbionohlpdbjgc?hl=en)
    - These can export the papers to bibtex format, if you use Latex.
  - use their Microsoft Word plugin to add references to report
    - [Zotero word processor plugin](https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_integration)
