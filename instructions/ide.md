## Code editor (IDE): 
Recommended: Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/. 
- This is suitable for both front end (JavaScript) and machine learing (Python) development;
- It is probably the most widely used IDE in industry;
- For front end, it is better for JavaScript development than other editors like Brackets (http://brackets.io/), Sublime Text (https://www.sublimetext.com/), or Notepad++ (https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
- For machine learning, it can run python fine and can open Jupyter notebooks (need to install relevant plugins)
