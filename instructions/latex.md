## Writing: Latex (instead of Word)
Recommended: Use Latex instead of Word for all the reports: proposal, progress report, final report, and viva.
- This will 
  - make your report look more professional
  - make the references easier
  - this is how many academic papers and books are written
- Recommended editor: Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/), like Google Docs for Latex.
