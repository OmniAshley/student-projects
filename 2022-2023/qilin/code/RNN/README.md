# RNN model
## Contents
- RNN_onehot.ipynb: A RNN model that applys onehot encoding on the URLs
- RNN_lexical.ipynb: A RNN model that applys lexical encoding to the URLs.
- model.json: a folder of pretrained RNN_onehot model
- model.json: a folder of pretrained RNN_lexical model
- .env : a file that specifies the path of installed nlp libraries.

## Usage
1. To set up the environment, go to .env file and change the path to your local directory. 
2. Import all the libraries and packages, may require installing using 'Conda' or Command line window.
3. Import dataset
4. Train the model on your data / load the pretrained model to fine-tune its parameters.
